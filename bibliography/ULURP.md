  date={2016-04-19},  
  comment = {An article recapping the ENY rezoning process, including notes on what could be done better, and how the city should handle future rezonings. ``Emily Goldstein, senior campaign organizer at the Association for Neighborhood Hosing and Development (ANHD), says there's a warning here for all future rezoning neighborhoods: Community advocates must seek to understand what the administration can truly guarantee, and what is beyond its ability to control. In addition, by focusing on the block-by-block specifics of the rezoning plan, advocates can ensure solid commitments. "If you scale down a little bit on the scope of the rezoning, then you scale down a little bit on the uncertainty," she says.'' ``For many advocates, the biggest disappointment is the lack of units for families making below 30 percent AMI, who make up approximately a third of the population of East New York or roughly 12,000 families. The plan guarantees only about 150 units for households with those incomes.'' ``The decline of federal investment in public housing and section 8 vouchers—historically, the main tools used to provide housing for "extremely low income" families—has left many cities struggling to provide shelter for their poorest residents. East New York advocates thought they could press de Blasio to devote more subsidies, but the administration insisted that the math doesn't work: if developers are required to provide more than 10 to 15 percent of units for people making below 30 percent AMI, administrators argued, they couldn't meet their operating costs, even with subsidies.'' ``"I think that the city has learned the extent to which local communities...want to be doing a detailed level of planning, and don't just want a vague promise, and aren't just willing to settle for what might have been the norm even five or ten years ago," says ANHD organizer Goldstein.'' ``There's at least one thing DCP has been doing differently in other rezoning neighborhoods: In Flushing, the Bronx's Jerome, and Staten Island's Bay Street, the city has begun its outreach efforts by forming a stakeholder advisory committee with local elected officials, community organizations and other local leaders. These committees have provoked different reactions: in Jerome, frustration with the exclusivity of an "invite-only" committee lead to the formation of the Bronx Coalition for a Community Vision, which developed its own plan. In Staten Island, however, Bobby Digi, the executive director of the nonprofit Island Voice and president of the North Shore Business Alliance, lauded both the diversity and inclusivity of the Bay Street steering committee. East Harlem is a whole other story, with a steering committee of local groups appointed by Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito that has developed its own neighborhood plan.''},

% references the fact, once again, that the city at the same time it depends on section 8 and public housing to serve the very lowest income people, doesn't support them because it sees them as federal problems. Meanwhile the feds continue to defund those programs.

  comment ={``Advocates of CBAs believe that CBAs give the residents affected by a development a say regarding all the ways in which a proposal may change the local community, without regard to whether those impacts fit neatly within the current definition of ``land use'' or environmental ``impacts.'' The normal land use process, advocates claim, focuses on traditional land use concerns, such as the height and bulk of a project, and accordingly does not always ensure that those most affected by the development have a voice in shaping all the ways in which the development could affect or benefit the community.60 CBAs allow neighborhoods to negotiate their own mitigation and benefits without having to worry about the Nollan-Dolan nexus and proportionality requirements, which might apply if the city were involved in the negotiations.'' CBAs have the benefit of not having to meet the Nollan-Dolan nexus, so communities can ask for whatever they want. But if governments start requesting or requiring CBAs it could legally undermine that and make Nollan-Dolan required: ``If the ``leverage'' community groups have to convince developers to enter into negotiations stems from an explicit or implicit requirement that landowner enter into a CBA before seeking government approval of the land use proposal, the courts may view the negotiations as posing no less (and perhaps more) risk of ``extortion,'' to use the Nollan Court’s term, than the local government’s processes at issue in that case.''
