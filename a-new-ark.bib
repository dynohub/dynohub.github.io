% category = this is the category of thinking the thing cited falls into. One word, big buckets, separate more than one with commas.  ---Rearrange this file by big categories, (instead of media type, which is basically irrelevant) but this field will let you have more than one for some entries

% thought = bigger not-as-specific thoughts tied to the concept in this entry. might be very loosely tied to this concept.

% Um... turns out you don't need to comment stuff in bibtex with a %

% "“It would be very easy for us to just say, ‘We did a survey and 75 percent of Oaklanders say they support Slow Streets,’” Mr. Russo said. “When you see the fact that it’s disproportionately folks who are higher-income who really enjoy it, and people who are white who are saying that, that’s a very important thing for government to be listening to.” Those survey response rates echo research on public meetings about development, conducted by the political scientists Katherine Levine Einstein, David Glick and Maxwell Palmer. The people who show up for such meetings, thus shaping what kind of housing is built, tend to be older, whiter, higher-income and homeowners.  Those are the people with more time for public meetings, the flexibility to show up on a weeknight, and motivation to do so. They also wield the most power when they speak, with their homeowner’s concerns about property values at stake, or with their credentials as engineers, architects or lawyers who have read the zoning code."

% "“Participation processes are broken in two different ways,” said Professor Einstein, who teaches at Boston University. “They’re weaponized by privileged white people. And then when less privileged communities do try to use them, they’re not as effective as a tool for them.” Jeremy Levine, a sociologist who spent several years following community meetings in poorer neighborhoods of Boston, found that those meetings often served to give officials and developers the power to say “the community” is on board.  “More meetings, better-attended meetings or differently designed meetings will not alleviate these fundamental challenges,” said Mr. Levine, a professor at the University of Michigan.  This is the reality as cities consider what it would mean to have more community input: In city planning, participatory democracy has largely increased inequality, not lessened it."

  comment={Sim City's algorithms were largely based on the theories put forth by Jay Forrester in his 1969 book Urban Dynamics. Forrester had built an early city simulator based on 150 equiations and 200 parameters. The simulator found that once the land area of a city was used up and the only way to grow was by replacing already existing structures, his simulated cities went into inevitable decline. This (unfortunately) matched what people were seeing with the urban crises of the 60s and 70s. Built into the models was classist assumptions, like the poor had higher birth rates, made fewer contributions to taxes, and increased public expenditures. (In addition, it was vastly oversimplified - almost to the point of an "outsider" like vision of cities.) Forrester was careful to not claim his simulations reflected particular cities, but made generalizations about cities in general. He claimed that programs aimed at helping the underemployed - particularly low-income housing - cost public resources and occupied land that could be more productively used for other thigns. Forrester's simulations gave a theoretical backing to conservative notions of "benign neglect" (ala Daniel Patrick Moynihan) hands-off urban policies. Forrester felt that throughout human history people have had a simplistic cause-and-effect approach to policy making based on our simplistic "mental models", but our social interactions are far more complex and we can't hold them in our heads. Because of that, he felt that the effects of social programs would be different than those imagined by policymakers. The intuitive solutions are "wrong most of the time". Things we do to try to improve society are likely to backfire. This is, of course, totally a conservative notion. Albert O. Hirschman calls this the "perversity thesis" and identifies it throughout history. Where a conservative speaker can claim they share your social goal, while simultaneasly arguing that your approach will only make it worse. ``Expert knowledge, of course, has an important place in democratic deliberation, but it can also cut people out of the policy process, dampen the urgency of moral claims, and program a sense of powerlessness into our public discourse. Appeals to a social system’s “complexity” and the potential for “perverse outcomes” can be enough to sink transformative social programs that are still on the drawing board. This might not matter in the context of a virtual environment like that of  Urban Dynamics or SimCity, but we have decades of real-world evidence that demonstrates the disastrous costs of the “counterintuitive” anti-welfare agenda. Straightforward solutions to poverty and economic misery—redistribution and  the provision of public services—have both empirical backing and moral force. Maybe it’s time we start listening to our intuition again. ''},

}
% This is such an interesting observation, but the causes are SO much more complicated than just the corporatization of retail or expensive real estate. Rich people - the shoppers - simply aren't as sophisticated as they used to be (or think they are). And the internet combined with fast-fashion has democratized what is cutting edge in terms of fashion and style. Being rich no longer entitles you to first access to new and inspiring styles - it just entitles you expensive styles. Similarly "luxury" items are no longer strongly correlated with well-made things or a rarefied aesthetic, they are just correlated with cost. One luxury car is basically indistinguishable from another nowadays. One luxury apartment looks just like the next.
% Instead, the truly beautiful, the new, and the culture-defining belong to the people who have the vision to seek them out, from the deepest corners of the internet and the dankest corners of upstate thrift stores. This is as it should be - let the rich rot with their bleached and boring overpriced and underwhelming junk.

  comment={San Francisco has been encouraging the development of high rises. Newer high rises are designed using computer modeling, but earthquakes are not predictable, and it's likely the models don't account for everything. The building code is pretty weak; it says buildings have to have a 90 percent chance of avoiding total collapse. Which means that 10 percent of the buildings COULD collapse. In addition, that's "total collapse" --- many buildings might stay upright but become nonfunctional and too expensive to repair. The Millennium Tower was built in 2009 and won all sorts of engineering awards. It has now sunk a foot and a half, and is leaning 14 inches towards its neighbors. Most of the development of high rises has been in the parts of San Francisco that are MOST at risk of liqufaction --- where the ground behaves like quicksand during an earthquake.},

US with a 2D representation of flood physics to produce estimates
of flood hazard, which match to within 90% accuracy the skill of local models built with detailed data. These flood depths are combined with exposure datasets of commensurate resolution to calculate current and future flood risk. Our data show that the total US population exposed to serious flooding is 2.6–3.1 times higher than
previous estimates, and that nearly 41 million Americans live within the 1% annual exceedance probability floodplain (compared to only 13 million when calculated using FEMA flood maps). We find that population and GDP growth alone are expected to lead to significant future increases in exposure, and this change may be exacerbated in the future by climate change.},

  date={2018-02-20},
  comment={``People living in cities are regularly exposed (against their will) to noise above 85 decibels from sources like traffic, subways, industrial activity, and airports. That’s enough to cause significant hearing loss over time. If you have an hour-long commute at such sound levels, your hearing has probably already been affected. Urban life also sustains average background noise levels of 60 decibels, which is loud enough to raise one’s blood pressure and heart rate, and cause stress, loss of concentration, and loss of sleep. Sirens are a particularly extreme example of the kind of noise inflicted on people every day: They ring at a sound-pressure level of 120 decibels —a level that corresponds with the human pain threshold, according to the World Health Organization.'' This article also retells the story of Julia Barnett Rice, the wealthy lady who fought against the sound of tugboat horns in the early part of the 20th Century. This article argues that her story set up a dynamic where noise was a nuisance to rich people --- who often got abatements at the cost of the livlihoods of poorer people, instead of a health issue affecting everyone. Still, city officials were often unwilling to curb industry noise because of the economic output of those businesses. But the noise from transportation and industrial businesses does the most health damage (not nightclibs). Noisy industrial businesses, airports, and highways tend to be near low-income neighborhoods.},

  Title={Tech Envisions the Ultimate Start-Up: An Entire City},
  journal={The New York Times},
  date={2018-02-24},
  comment={Some people in the tech industry dream of building whole cities from scratch, arguing that cities aren't evolving the way technology is. This is not radically different from other unsuccessful attempts at utopians cities built from the ground up --- which generally fail spectacularly. There is some arguments that many of the things that the tech dreamers want are similar to what urbanists want --- transit connections, affordable housing, dense walkable mixed neighborhoods. But the technologists want to solve the problems through engineering and technology, rather than fixing our current cities though politics. The technologists prize "first principles" --- the idea that breaking new ground opens new solutions, and also implies that historical awareness and traditional expertise can be limiting. They equate their ideas with early radical ideas about cities, like grids. And they suggest maybe all the rules of a city could fit in 100 pages. This article points out that urban planning utopias are not the only thing that failed, but even within technology planning has failed in the past --- NASA tried to get into the planning game back in the 1960s, thinking that their groundbreaking technologies in space exploration could be applied to all sorts of fields. ``Technologically optimized cities, he says, failed then for the same reason they would be unsuccessful now. Technology can help reduce traffic, or connect you faster to a ride home. “But a city is not at its fundamental level optimizable,” he said. A city’s dynamism derives from its inefficiencies, from people and ideas colliding unpredictably. It’s also unclear what you’d optimize an entire city for. Technologists describe noble aspirations like “human flourishing” or “quality of life.” But noble goals come into conflict within cities.''},

  comment={Painted in broad simple strokes, Krugman outlines the dichotomy between Houston's no-regulation environment and how it contributed to the flooding disaster of Hurricane Harvey, and San Francisco's NIMBYist environment and how it contributes to the affordable housing crisis for low-income workers. Krugman points out that this is one of the few places where he agrees with the "both sides get it wrong" philosophy. He points out the San Francisco and Houston are extreme examples, but not that extreme in that many of the aspects that those cities represent are reflected in other major coastal cities versus southern sunbelt cities. Namely that there is nearly no regulation in the sunbelt cities, and NIMBYism prevents nearly anything from being done in the coastal elite cities.},

% Mostly I'm with Krugman in criticising NIMBYism, but there is an element to this where he is being both too much of an economist and too much focussed on the individual issue of affordable housing, rather than overall affordability of cities. 
% On econmics because I know fundamentally he believes in the basic supply and demand issue of housing, where if more housing is built at any price range, housing becomes cheaper overall. This has been proven wrong time and again in the real world, but it doesn't stop economists from believing it.
% And the affordability of housing in those elite coastal cities is off-set to a large degree (though usually not entirely) by lower transportation costs. If you take into account the ability to live in NYC without owning a car, the affordability of the city dives into the average range.
% See also this in-depth article on the same subject: \url{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/11/climate/houston-flooding-climate.html}
``the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes.  The problem is that hurricanes and floods, worsened by climate change, do not recognize political borders or county lines. Their toll is shared by everyone.''
``But what does “affordable” really mean if residents have to pay hefty transportation costs and rebuild, time and again, after floods? Houston’s affordability leans on loosely regulated, low-cost immigrant labor providing an abundance of cheaply made, slab-on-grade, single-family houses that sprawl on all that open land, in areas like the Katy Prairie.  And it relies heavily on American taxpayers providing government tax credits, mortgage interest deductions, gas subsidies, artificially low flood insurance rates, highway construction money — and emergency relief, including buying out homeowners to remove their properties from harm’s way.''

% What he doesn't make clear is the ratio of sprawl versus growth. One could argue that places with space to spread out are doing so BECAUSE of increased urbanization. So it still COULD BE a back-to-the-city movement in those places, but with a lack of transit the only option to reach an affordable living situation is by car, and so people hit the suburbs. It may be they don't WANT the suburbs, but are forced there for economic reasons. And they choose that over rural areas because they want to be as close to the city center as they can reasonably afford.
% In this telling (for which no data is provided here) the city centers might still be growing, but the suburbs grow faster for affordability reasons, making the data look like people are still choosing suburbs over cities. Meanwhile in a place like seattle, people can afford to be where they want to be, and there is transit, so the city center grows.

Identification is aided by both institutional hurdles and idiosyncratic delays in the municipalisation process. Municipalisation lowered deaths from typhoid fever, a waterborne disease, by nearly 20% but deaths from non-waterborne causes were unaffected. Results are also robust to the adoption of several strategies that control for the possibility of mean reversion and other potential confounds.},

He points out that this is the first urban century in human history (meaning, more people now live in cities than not). He talks about the Grand Canal, a mega project from the end of the 19th century to drain away the sewage from the city, originally gravity-driven, but now having to pump out the waste. He talks about plazas sinking around their monuments, hills forming where it was flat, undulating streets, and cracks opening up. This is all due to climate change, even though Mexico City is in the middle of the continent, it's not at risk the same way a coastal city is. The city built over its permeable soil so the water table is draining under it, and it sinks at different rates depending on the soil.},

% Need to track down the actual paper this article is about.
% Not mentioned here is the artists who are the first _white_ people to move into a high-crime neighborhood. They might have similar low-incomes as the current residents, and so are willing to take the risk of moving there. But once they are there, more white people around might make wealthier people feel like it's now a safe neighborhood. (Not to mention that developes see artists moving in and start building new buildings for wealthier people - a visual cue that for the rich that it's a place to move to.) It's the fact that they are WHITE that might actually make it seem safe for the rich, before the crime rate actually drops.
% The crime rate dropping is an indicator for the VERY wealthy that they can move in.
% and then of course the rich drive the artists on to other neighborhoods.
% See also that crime dropped drastically in NYC in 2016: \url{http://gothamist.com/2017/01/04/new_york_citys_crime_rate.php} This article interenestingly says "You never trust the numbers produced by an agency whose performance is evaluated by producing numbers," he said.

This paper uses a data set of more than 4,000,000 commuter flows as the basis for an empirical approach to the identification of such megaregions. We compare a method which uses a visual heuristic for understanding areal aggregation to a method which uses a computational partitioning algorithm, and we reflect upon the strengths and limitations of both. We discuss how choices about input parameters and scale of analysis can lead to different results, and stress the importance of comparing computational results with “common sense” interpretations of geographic coherence. The results provide a new perspective on the functional economic geography of the United States from a megaregion perspective, and shed light on the old geographic problem of the division of space into areal units.},

  comment={A nice little history of ``urban renewal'' and all the problems associated with it. ``Urban renewal was fundamentally about places, not people — and the people in the way of redeveloping those places were often scattered to other slums or housing they could not afford. Seldom were they welcomed back to what was built in place of their homes. And less than 1 percent of all federal spending for urban renewal between 1949 and 1964 went to relocation, Mr. Gans wrote.'' ``Four units of low-income housing were destroyed for every one new unit that was built. And more than two-thirds of the displaced were black or Hispanic, a pattern that was clear by 1963 when the author James Baldwin observed that urban renewal “means Negro removal.”'' ``The psychologist Marc Fried, studying the same West End community, later documented the severe grief those residents experienced after they lost their homes. They lived through what the Columbia researcher Mindy Fullilove has today eloquently named “root shock.” Pull people from their communities, she argues, and they experience trauma not unlike what happens when you uproot a plant.''},

We prove this claim in a system of cities with heterogeneous sites and either free mobility or local governments, where  agglomeration economies, congestion, federal taxation, and land ownership create wedges. A quantitative version of our model suggests that cities may well be too numerous and underpopulated for a wide range of plausible parameter values. The welfare costs of free migration equilibria appear small, whereas they seem substantial when local governments control city size.},

  comment={An excellent easy to understand overview of the modifiable unit area problem (MUAP) and problems with measuring density. Makes the argument that it isn't density per se that is good about cities but some of the aspects of density. References research that shows that happily living in a city is having a good commute and being able to easily get to all the things you need for living (post office, church, library, grocery store, restaurant, bar, cafe). This can be achieved in small towns if things are close together. Also: ``But it isn’t just convenience and transportation efficiency that draws so many of today’s urbanists to prize density. They point to the ways that density nurtures both innovation and social diversity to argue that there are fundamental “agglomeration effects” which result from gathering people and businesses together in close proximity. There’s certainly something to this: the geographer Waldo Tobler’s famous “first law of geography” states that “near things are more related than distant things,” and we are undoubtedly more likely to participate in both acts of social solidarity and economic interchange with people who are close at hand than with those who are far distant.  But it’s naïve to assume that all people have equal access to one another just because they happen to be bumping shoulders—a fantasy bred in the cozy atmosphere of elite college campuses and well-decorated coffeehouses. In reality, our social and economic interactions are highly stratified by barriers like race, gender, education, and class.''},

But there is a darker side to it. The urban village ethos has encouraged prosperous neighborhoods to turn inward and even take pride in not connecting with fellow citizens in the suburban areas beyond.'' ``The language we still hold on to about the inner city disguises the changes that have taken place. We still invoke the social justice battles of urban neighborhoods of the past — community, environment, heritage, people power — in an endless war to fight for even greater advantages for ourselves.'' ``The challenge for our city and many like it is to think beyond the urban villages. The passion for well-designed communities needs to be directed outward instead of inward, geographically and in spirit. We need to let go of some of our resources; we need to learn to share. And if we are going to fight for our perfect little villages, the most honorable fight is the one to retain and expand public housing, to keep what little diversity we have left.''},

It is being reimagined as the centerpiece of a New Urbanist development, but the community fought that, so now it's the centerpiece of a old-age mcmansion development. This article quotes Alexander Gorlin as saying ``“The 100-foot width of the atrium is equal to many great avenues and public spaces historically, including Lincoln Road, one of the great pedestrian streets that Morris Lapidus adapted to the pedestrian mall, and the Crystal Palace in London, and St. Peter’s Basilica … ” According to Gorlin, whether it’s measured in feet or meters, the width is always the same. “It’s some kind of human dimension of grandeur and intimacy,”'' },

In Paris, the poor are banished beyond the périphérique so that when they revolt, they destroy their own banlieues rather than the French capital’s fussily maintained environment.'' ``Manhattan island is today a pristine vitrine on which the lower orders don’t even get to leave their mucky paw prints, but inside which the rich get to fulfil with unparallelled freedom their uninteresting desires.'' ``The point of the cities Benjamin loved, by contrast, was that they broke through physical, ethnic and class barriers.

Yet understanding the variety of these forms can help stakeholders make wise choices regarding how to plan and design urban regions in the future to meet goals such as livability and sustainability. Based on aerials, maps, and images available through Google and other sources, I develop a typology of built landscape forms found within 24 metropolitan regions worldwide and use GIS to map these forms and compare regions. The analysis shows that 27 basic types of built landscape make up metropolitan regions worldwide, of which nine are very common. Traditional urban types now make up a small fraction of most metropolitan areas worldwide, while suburban and exurban forms comprise the vast majority of the land area. There are noted regional differences in the mix of built landscape types.Takeaway for practice: Each built landscape form offers challenges and opportunities for planning objectives such as livability and sustainability. It is important for planners to a) help the public and decision makers understand built landscapes and their implications; b) include landscape-scale elements, such as street patterns and networks of green infrastructure, when framing urban development alternatives; c) ensure that local codes and design guidelines enable desired forms of built landscapes and discourage those that are problematic for sustainability; and d) encourage built landscape change that promotes sustainability. },

This paper examines these questions within a model of recombinant growth and endogenous local amenities. Three primary factors determine the trade-off between networks and big cities: local returns to scale in innovation, the elasticity of housing supply, and the importance of local amenities. Even if there are global increasing returns, the returns to local scale in innovation may be decreasing, and that makes networks more appealing than mega-cities. Inelastic housing supply makes it harder to supply more space in dense confines, which perhaps explains why networks are more popular in regulated Europe than in the American Sunbelt. Larger cities can dominate networks because of amenities, as long as the benefits of scale overwhelm the downsides of density. In our framework, the skilled are more likely to prefer mega-cities than the less skilled, and the long-run benefits of either mega-cities or networks may be quite different from the short-run benefits.},

The trend goes back to at least the 1840s, but grew particularly strong during the middle decades of the 20th century.'' ``starting in the early 1980s, the long trend toward regional equality abruptly switched. Since then, geography has come roaring back as a determinant of economic fortune, as a few elite cities have surged ahead of the rest of the country in their wealth and income.'' ``But over the last generation this trend, too, has reversed. Since 1980, the states and metro areas with the highest and fastest-growing per capita incomes have generally seen hardly, if any, net domestic in-migration, and in many notable examples have seen more people move away to other parts of the country than move in. Today, the preponderance of domestic migration is from areas with high and rapidly growing incomes to relatively poorer areas where incomes are growing at a slower pace, if at all.'' ``Throughout most of the country’s history, American government at all levels has pursued policies designed to preserve local control of businesses and to check the tendency of a few dominant cities to monopolize power over the rest of the country. These efforts moved to the federal level beginning in the late 19th century and reached a climax of enforcement in the 1960s and ’70s. Yet starting shortly thereafter, each of these policy levers were flipped, one after the other, in the opposite direction, usually in the guise of “deregulation.” Understanding this history, largely forgotten today, is essential to turning the problem of inequality around.'' Mostly we are talking about anti-trust regulations and anti-big-chain-store regulations of the 20s and 30s, led by Woodrow Wilson and Louis Brandeis, which prevented wealth from concentrating in big cities. But also includes laws preventing patent monopolies and bank mergers. Also tackles the decline of transit funding.},

We test a key empirical prediction of this theory: that inventions in large cities build on newer ideas than inventions in smaller cities. We analyze the idea inputs of nearly every US patent granted during 1836–2010. We find that a larger city size provided a considerable advantage in inventive activities during most of the 20th century but that in recent decades this advantage has eroded.},

  comment = {Max's review of Good Neighbors by Sylvie Tissot. ``Through such benign-sounding activities as philanthropy, historic preservation, and serving on committees for parks and liquor licenses, gentrifiers solidified their position in the community and began to erase the cultural presence of those who preceded them. Tissot draws on years of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews, as well as historical material on the South End (much of which appears in fascinating boxed-text asides), to demonstrate how culture was used as a cudgel in a protracted battle of neighborhood realpolitik.'' ``Tissot implies that these gentrifiers, in prioritizing upper-middle-class, white prerogatives, did not just disagree over the proper uses of public spaces but were specifically drawn to concerns that privileged their cultural knowledge and maintained them in a position of prominence.'' ``Good Neighbors powerfully demonstrates how gentrifiers often fixate on the old (homes) and the marginally political (greenmarkets) so that they do not have to think about the displacement involved in neighborhood change and their own role in it.'' ``Newcomers endeavor to project a relaxed and egalitarian nature by working through civic groups rather than more formal channels of institutional and state power (although these are always there if they need them). Yet within these groups they create many barriers for participation: from inconvenient meeting times to all-but-mandatory large donations and discussions held in a language of corporate-speak and legalese.''},

  Title={Is Gentrification Really a Problem?},
  journal={The New Yorker},
  date={2016-07-11},
  comment={Discusses the use of the word `ghetto' to mean something bad. And how ``The opposite of gentrification is not a quirky and charming enclave that stays affordable forever; the opposite of gentrification is a decline in prices that reflects the transformation of a once desirable neighborhood into one that is looking more like a ghetto every day.'' Also covers how, while in NYC poor black neighborhoods might be likely to gentrify, this isn't (yet) the case in other places, like Chicago.  ``Do tenants have a political right—a human right—to remain in their apartments? In New York, regulations like rent stabilization not only limit the amount by which some landlords can raise rents but also restrict a landlord’s ability to decline to renew a lease. In Sweden, the rules are tighter: rents are set through a national negotiation between tenants and landlords, which means that prices are low in Stockholm, but apartments are scarce; a renter in search of a long-term lease there might spend decades on a government waiting list. Another solution is to allow more and taller buildings, increasing supply in the hope of lowering prices. Often, the steepest rent increases are found in places, like San Francisco, that have stringent building regulations: a recent study of the city found that fewer poor residents had been displaced in neighborhoods with more new construction. In seeking to preserve what Ruth Glass called the “social character” of a neighborhood, anti-gentrification activists echo the language that was once used to defend racially restrictive covenants. Arguments over gentrification are really arguments over who deserves to live in a city, and the notion of a right to stay put is sometimes at odds with another, perhaps more fundamental right: the right to move.'' ``In the ghetto narrative, a poor neighborhood falls victim to isolation; in the gentrification narrative, a poor neighborhood falls victim to invasion. These stories are not necessarily contradictory—they reflect a common conviction that the sorrows and joys of neighborhood change tend to be unequally shared. One effect of gentrification is to make this inequality harder to ignore. The call to save a neighborhood is most compelling when it serves as a call to help a neighborhood’s neediest inhabitants. That might mean helping them stay. But it might also mean helping them leave.''},
  category={Urbanism}
}
% Refers to the freeman2005displacement paper as evidence that gentrification doesn't impact poor households negatively. He backs this up with another bit of research by Kathe Newman and Elvin Wyly called The Right to Stay Put Revisited, which finds displacement is a problem, but maybe a mild one.

doi = {10.1177/0042098014561723}, 
abstract ={Urban scholars have described the importance of gentrification in major cities across the USA since the 1970s. While there is consensus that gentrification shaped social and physical aspects of neighbourhoods, scholars have yet to agree on how gentrified neighbourhoods should be identified. Owing to the lack of consensus, gentrification was measured in a variety of ways, which greatly influenced the neighbourhoods studied in previous research and potentially the findings of research that assessed the importance of gentrification for other neighbourhood outcomes. The current study contributes to this debate by applying and comparing two census-based strategies for identifying gentrified neighbourhoods with a qualitative neighbourhood selection strategy derived from The New York Times to New York City neighbourhoods for the span of years from 1980 to 2009. Results confirm that each of the strategies identified different neighbourhoods and that qualitative strategies for identifying gentrified neighbourhoods may overlook areas that experienced similar changes to those more widely recognised as gentrified. Given these findings, additional analyses assessed which census-based neighbourhood selection strategy better represented the neighbourhoods perceived by The New York Times, a major media outlet that shaped discourse on gentrification in the USA, as having experienced gentrification.},

Some of these areas began as “suburbs within the city” in the 1800s and early 1900s and have maintained their positions atop the neighborhood hierarchy thanks to their appeal to a subset of high-income households.'' ``New York stands out from most other cities in that so many of its top households live in the middle of the central city. These super-rich neighborhoods — which spread into previously affordable areas, giving rise to much recent debate on gentrification — form the densest concentration of affluence in the United States, eclipsing the smaller privileged areas that have recently gentrified in Boston and DC.'' ``The productivity and higher costs of big CZs do not translate to higher incomes, education levels, and housing values in their bottom tracts. If anything, conditions in the bottom tracts are a little better on average in the smaller CZs — measured on this national scale — than in larger ones. The processes that add up to clustering by affluent households in privileged neighborhoods may therefore be leaving disadvantaged people behind in distressed neighborhoods.''},

  category={Housing, mid, mortgage interest deduction, poverty, income, CUP, affordable housing}
}
% ``the federal government dedicated nearly $134 billion to homeowner subsidies. The MID accounted for the biggest chunk of the total, $71 billion, with real estate tax deductions, capital gains exclusions and other expenditures accounting for the rest. That number, $134 billion, was larger than the entire budgets of the Departments of Education, Justice and Energy combined for that year. It is a figure that exceeds half the entire gross domestic product of countries like Chile, New Zealand and Portugal.'' 
% ``When we think of entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare immediately come to mind. But by any fair standard, the holy trinity of United States social policy should also include the mortgage-interest deduction — an enormous benefit that has also become politically untouchable.'' 
% ``Americans assume that most poor families live in subsidized housing, the opposite is true; nationwide, only one in four households that qualifies for rental assistance receives it.'' 
% ``Because of rising housing costs and stagnant wages, slightly more than half of all poor renting families in the country spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing costs, and at least one in four spends more than 70 percent. Yet America’s national housing policy gives affluent homeowners large benefits; middle-class homeowners, smaller benefits; and most renters, who are disproportionately poor, nothing. It is difficult to think of another social policy that more successfully multiplies America’s inequality in such a sweeping fashion'' 
% The GI Bill was the largest social program ever -- and was specifically set up to not be accessible to people of color. This was decades before redlining even began.
% ``Racial exclusion was Roosevelt’s first concession to pass the New Deal; his second, to avoid a tax revolt, was to rely on regressive and largely hidden payroll taxes to fund generous social-welfare programs. A result, the historian Michelmore observes, is that we “never asked ordinary taxpayers to pay for the economic security many soon came to expect as a matter of right.” In providing millions of middle-class families stealth benefits, the American government rendered itself invisible to those families, who soon came to see their success as wholly self-made. We forgot because we were not meant to remember.'' 
% ``There is another reason most MID benefits accrue to the top, even among homeowners: You have to itemize your deductions to claim it. Most taxpayers don’t bother because they don’t make enough money to justify the hassle. In 2014, 1.5 million households earning between $40,000 and $50,000 a year claimed the MID, receiving an average benefit of $14 a month. That same year, 6.5 million households with earnings above $200,000 claimed the MID and enjoyed an average benefit of $391 a month. What this means in aggregate is that households with at least six-figure incomes receive more than four-fifths of the total value of mortgage interest and property-tax deductions.'' 
% ``So why do we keep this “poor instrument” around, if the overarching goal of American federal housing policy is to create a nation of homeowners? Perhaps because the MID enjoys entrenched, unyielding support from a powerful real estate lobby. We often discuss the influence of the gun and pharmaceutical lobbies, but the real estate lobby has spent much more than either group. We often discuss the influence of the gun and pharmaceutical lobbies, but the real estate lobby has spent much more than either group.  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the National Association of Realtors spent $64.8 million in lobbying efforts in 2016, making it second only to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in terms of dollars spent.'' 
% ``Would we support reform that provided desperately needed housing relief to millions of low-income Americans if it meant that the net worth of those who owned expensive homes took a hit? The answer is almost certainly no, at least for owners of houses valued north of $500,000. Wealth granted by a bizarre government subsidy is still wealth, and once people have it, they’d prefer to keep it. When it comes to public housing for the rich, it becomes hard to break the cycle of welfare dependency. It’s why some Democratic leaders who represent districts with high housing prices, like Representative Nancy Pelosi (San Francisco) and Senator Chuck Schumer (New York), have been outspoken critics of MID reform, even if they are consistent backers of other equality-promoting initiatives.'' 
% ``We tend to speak about the poor as if they didn’t live in the same society, as if our gains and their losses weren’t intertwined. Conservatives explain poverty by pointing to “individual factors,” like bad decisions or the rise of single-parent families; liberals refer to “structural causes,” like the decline of manufacturing or the historical legacies of racial discrimination. Usually pitted against each other, each perspective serves a similar function: letting us off the hook by asserting that there is a deep-rooted, troubling problem — more than one in six Americans does not make enough to afford basic necessities — that most of us bear no responsibility for.''

  author={Stromberg, Brian and Sturtevant, Lisa},
  year={2016},
  url={Real Estate Boom Pinches a Produce Supply in the Hudson Valley},
  abstract={More than 500 local inclusionary zoning (IZ) programs have been implemented in communities across the country. In most cases, these IZ policies are adopted as part of a larger local strategy to expand housing options that are affordable to lower income households.  IZ policies have been adopted in a wide range of places, from big cities to suburban communities to rural areas. But what makes one community more quickly adopt an IZ policy than another community? Using a database developed in collaboration with the National CLT Network (now Grounded Solutions), researchers at NHC and the University of Maryland developed a model to explain the rate of IZ adoption in local jurisdictions across the country.  When states expressly authorize inclusionary zoning, local jurisdictions have an easier time adopting a local IZ program. Other community characteristics that are associated with adoption of a local IZ program include: higher population densities, higher shares of rent-burdened households, lower home ownership rates, and a lower share of Democratic voters. These research findings can help advocates target their education and outreach efforts as they seek to expand the number and the effectiveness of IZ programs across the country.},

The existing literature emphasizes discriminatory institutions as the driving force behind this rapid rise in segregation.  Using newly assembled neighborhood-level data, we instead focus on the role of “flight” by whites, providing the first systematic evidence of the role that prewar population dynamics played in the emergence of the American ghetto.  Leveraging exogenous changes in neighborhood racial composition, we show that white departures in response to black arrivals were quantitatively large and accelerated between 1900 and 1930.  Our preferred estimates suggest that white flight was responsible for 34 percent of the increase in segregation over the 1910s and 50 percent over the 1920s.  Our analysis suggests that segregation would likely have arisen in American cities even without the presence of discriminatory institutions as a direct consequence of the widespread and decentralized relocation decisions of white urban residents.},

Today the city has 2,422 residential units—1,525 occupied and 897 vacant in the program. Some community groups now want to turn the remaining buildings into Community Land Trusts (CLT) combined with Mutual Housing Associations (MHA) which allows tenants living in separate apartment buildings to cross-subsidize their rents and pool their utility and maintenance costs to save money. The intention is to remove these buildings from the speculative real estate market. Many of the buildings are in poor shape. They need investment, and of course the city's current plan is to use Affordable Neighborhood Cooperative Program (ANCP) loans which allow the units to be sold to families making up to 100k.},

Subsequently, housing-price inequality has risen to pre-War levels, while rent inequality has risen less. Combining both measures, we see inequality in housing consumption equivalents mirroring patterns in income across both space and time, according to an income elasticity of housing demand just below one.  These patterns occur mainly within cities, and are not explained by observed changes in dwelling characteristics or locations. Instead, recent increases in housing inequality are driven most by changes in the relative value of locations, seen especially through land.},

Landlords may raise a preferential rent by more than the Rent Guidelines Board limits — except that for original tenants in a rent-stabilized building, the legal rent is the initial rent paid, even if it’s called “preferential.”"

% And this follow up article about new legislation proposed: \url{https://www.propublica.org/article/ny-lawmakers-want-stiffer-penalties-for-landlords-who-ignore-rent-limits} This article also covers the fact that there around 800,000 units actually registered, even though there's supposed to be 1 million units that are rent stabilized.

But by setting a limit to rent stabilization they created an incentive for landlords to drive rents up until they could reach the vacancy decontrol point and make their apartment free-market rent.

Against that backdrop, support for Mr. Trump and for the British withdrawal known as Brexit are just imperfect vehicles through which someone can yell, “Stop.”'' the ``gaps between the economic elite and the general public are created not by differences in expertise but in priorities.'' Covers an experiment published in Science that showed that while a big portion of the American public would divide the equally over efficiently, this was not true of people attending Yale law school, who  divided the pie efficiently over equally. Argues for rent control: ``Economists almost uniformly argue that rent control laws are a terrible tool to try to make housing more affordable. As Paul Krugman once wrote, “the analysis of rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics, and — among economists, anyway — one of the least controversial.” Yet among people grappling with soaring rents, the policies are persistently popular — even, recently, in the free-market-oriented boomtowns of Silicon Valley.  It’s easy for an economist to chalk up support for rent control as idiocy that depresses the home construction that might reduce housing prices for everyone. I have thought of it that way.  But maybe it is really important for people who live in a place to be able to stay there indefinitely. Maybe the idea that things should stay the way they are, without new people moving in and new buildings going up, is not as inherently irrational as Economics 101 would suggest. Yes, rent control is a bad idea if you’re worried about the long-term prospects for economic efficiency. But maybe the people who advocate these policies know exactly what they’re rooting for, and that’s not it.  The rent control debate can be viewed as a microcosm of the debate about globalization and international trade.'' ``There’s an obligation to think about individual lives. Life isn’t just about money, and jobs aren’t just about income. A sense of stability, of purpose, of social standing — all these things matter in ways that economic models don’t do a very good job of taking into account.''},

% 1.  Tax bills go up, even when the tax rate does not.
% 2.  Effective tax rates (taxes as a percent of market value) vary among types of property with home owners paying much lower rates than owners of commercial and residential rental property; and, these differentials are far greater than in other cities.
% 3.  Within each of the major types of property, the effective tax rate paid by owners varies widely in an often inequitable manner.

  journal={City Limits},
  date={2016-04-19},
  comment = {An article recapping the ENY rezoning process, including notes on what could be done better, and how the city should handle future rezonings. ``Emily Goldstein, senior campaign organizer at the Association for Neighborhood Hosing and Development (ANHD), says there's a warning here for all future rezoning neighborhoods: Community advocates must seek to understand what the administration can truly guarantee, and what is beyond its ability to control. In addition, by focusing on the block-by-block specifics of the rezoning plan, advocates can ensure solid commitments. "If you scale down a little bit on the scope of the rezoning, then you scale down a little bit on the uncertainty," she says.'' ``For many advocates, the biggest disappointment is the lack of units for families making below 30 percent AMI, who make up approximately a third of the population of East New York or roughly 12,000 families. The plan guarantees only about 150 units for households with those incomes.'' ``The decline of federal investment in public housing and section 8 vouchers—historically, the main tools used to provide housing for "extremely low income" families—has left many cities struggling to provide shelter for their poorest residents. East New York advocates thought they could press de Blasio to devote more subsidies, but the administration insisted that the math doesn't work: if developers are required to provide more than 10 to 15 percent of units for people making below 30 percent AMI, administrators argued, they couldn't meet their operating costs, even with subsidies.'' ``"I think that the city has learned the extent to which local communities...want to be doing a detailed level of planning, and don't just want a vague promise, and aren't just willing to settle for what might have been the norm even five or ten years ago," says ANHD organizer Goldstein.'' ``There's at least one thing DCP has been doing differently in other rezoning neighborhoods: In Flushing, the Bronx's Jerome, and Staten Island's Bay Street, the city has begun its outreach efforts by forming a stakeholder advisory committee with local elected officials, community organizations and other local leaders. These committees have provoked different reactions: in Jerome, frustration with the exclusivity of an "invite-only" committee lead to the formation of the Bronx Coalition for a Community Vision, which developed its own plan. In Staten Island, however, Bobby Digi, the executive director of the nonprofit Island Voice and president of the North Shore Business Alliance, lauded both the diversity and inclusivity of the Bay Street steering committee. East Harlem is a whole other story, with a steering committee of local groups appointed by Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito that has developed its own neighborhood plan.''},

% references the fact, once again, that the city at the same time it depends on section 8 and public housing to serve the very lowest income people, doesn't support them because it sees them as federal problems. Meanwhile the feds continue to defund those programs.

  comment ={``Advocates of CBAs believe that CBAs give the residents affected by a development a say regarding all the ways in which a proposal may change the local community, without regard to whether those impacts fit neatly within the current definition of ``land use'' or environmental ``impacts.'' The normal land use process, advocates claim, focuses on traditional land use concerns, such as the height and bulk of a project, and accordingly does not always ensure that those most affected by the development have a voice in shaping all the ways in which the development could affect or benefit the community.60 CBAs allow neighborhoods to negotiate their own mitigation and benefits without having to worry about the Nollan-Dolan nexus and proportionality requirements, which might apply if the city were involved in the negotiations.'' CBAs have the benefit of not having to meet the Nollan-Dolan nexus, so communities can ask for whatever they want. But if governments start requesting or requiring CBAs it could legally undermine that and make Nollan-Dolan required: ``If the ``leverage'' community groups have to convince developers to enter into negotiations stems from an explicit or implicit requirement that landowner enter into a CBA before seeking government approval of the land use proposal, the courts may view the negotiations as posing no less (and perhaps more) risk of ``extortion,'' to use the Nollan Court’s term, than the local government’s processes at issue in that case.''

Even as stricter federal standards push cars to become more fuel efficient, the gains have been steadily offset as Americans drive more.'' Includes links to studies (plural) showing that people in compact cities have a smaller carbon footprint than those living in spawl or suburban areas. ``This is partly because they often live in apartments that require less energy to heat and cool than large single-family homes, but also because they commute shorter distances and are more likely to walk or take public transit.'' But land use and zoning varies in every locality, so it can be very difficult to implement large-scale change. Even though land use impacts everything.

  comment={An update on the Bushwick rezoning. Makes the point that nobody knows if it is better to upzone, downzone, or have a hydbrid. And maybe it doesn't even matter, maybe zoning doesn't have the power to control displacement and gentrification. ``As City Limits reported on Tuesday, the relationship between rezonings and displacement is poorly understood. Contextual zonings may preserve neighborhood form, but they don’t necessarily stop displacement; some say they worsen it by limiting the citywide allowing housing supply, creating more competition for existing units. But upzonings also bears risks: Encouraging investment in the neighborhood could drive up prices in housing units nearby. And one study showed that after “hybrid” rezonings—a combination of a contextual rezoning on side streets and an upzoning on commercial corridors—rents also skyrocketed, and demographic change was even starker. In other words, when it comes to using zoning to curb displacement, it seems you’re damned if you boost density, damned if you reduce density, and damned if you do nothing at all—and, perhaps, damned if you even try to talk about it.''},

% It still seems very likely that the increased salary average of industrial jobs might be entirely because of the remaining union jobs. If the retail jobs were unionized, it's possible THAT would be the sector that pays the best.

abstract = { Problem, research strategy, and findings: Income segregation has risen in each of the last four decades in U.S. metropolitan areas, which can have lifelong impacts on the health, economic productivity, and behaviors of residents. Although it is widely assumed that local land use regulations—such as minimum lot sizes and growth controls—exclude low-income households from wealthier neighborhoods, the empirical research is surprisingly limited. We examine the relationship between land use regulation and segregation by income using new measures for the 95 biggest cities in the United States. We find that density restrictions are associated with the segregation of the wealthy and middle income, but not the poor. We also find that more local pressure to regulate land use is linked to higher rates of income segregation, but that more state control is connected to lower-income segregation.Takeaway for practice: Density restrictions do drive urban income segregation of the rich, not the poor, but should be addressed because rich enclaves create significant metropolitan problems. Planners at the local level need assistance from regional and state efforts to ameliorate income segregation. Inclusionary housing requirements have a greater potential to reduce income segregation than bringing higher-income households into lower-income parts of the city. Finally, comprehensive and consistent data on the impacts of local land use regulations should be collected to inform future research and planning practice. },
comment = {Covered by Richard Florida in this article: \url{http://www.citylab.com/housing/2016/01/how-zoning-restrictions-make-segregation-worse/422352/}. Florida sums up: ``the authors find that the main effect of density restrictions is to enable the wealthy to wall themselves off from other groups.'' ``Density restrictions in the city not only lead to higher housing prices (think San Francisco), but to greater economic segregation across a metro as a whole.'' ``segregation varies by both the nature and extent of government involvement, as well as the type of land use restriction. Notably, the authors discover that segregation is not associated with a broad measure of land use restriction overall, but is instead the result of more specific types of regulation and restrictiveness.'' ``Places that require multiple levels of approval to get housing built are more segregated, largely because such regulations hinder new housing development.'' ``Segregation is lower in cities and metros where state governments are more involved in land use regulation, residential development, and growth management.'' ``the authors point out that “efforts to force wealthier parts of [the] city to build housing for low-income households, or inclusionary housing, are more effective at reducing segregation than bringing higher-income households into lower-income parts of the city.”''},

% So while over 40 percent of the City’s land lots were rezoned during the Bloomberg administration, only 28 percent of the City’s residential units have been rezoned. (See Figure 2). This is because a significant numbers of the rezoned land lots were in lower - density neighborhoods and therefore account for a disproportionately low share of the City’s residential units.

We provide new evidence on helmet laws by studying Canada using difference-in-differences models and restricted area-identified public health survey data with information on cycling and helmet use for nearly 800,000 individuals from 1994-2014.  We first confirm prior patterns from the US that laws requiring youths to wear helmets significantly increased youth helmet use.  We then provide the literature’s first comprehensive evidence that ‘all-age’ bicycle helmet laws significantly increased both adult and youth helmet use by 50 to 190 percent relative to pre-reform levels, with larger effects for younger adults, and less-educated adults.  All-age helmet laws had modest effects at reducing cycling and increasing in-home exercise during winter months among adults but did not meaningfully affect weight.  Finally, we find larger effects of helmet laws at increasing helmet use for adults with children in the household, consistent with role-modeling behavior.  Overall our findings confirm that all-age helmet laws can be effective at increasing population helmet use without significant unintended adverse health consequences.},

	abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to calculate exposure-based bicycling hospitalisation rates in Canadian jurisdictions with different helmet legislation and bicycling mode shares, and to examine whether the rates were related to these differences.Methods Administrative data on hospital stays for bicycling injuries to 10 body region groups and national survey data on bicycling trips were used to calculate hospitalisation rates. Rates were calculated for 44 sex, age and jurisdiction strata for all injury causes and 22 age and jurisdiction strata for traffic-related injury causes. Inferential analyses examined associations between hospitalisation rates and sex, age group, helmet legislation and bicycling mode share.Results In Canada, over the study period 2006{\textendash}2011, there was an average of 3690 hospitalisations per year and an estimated 593 million annual trips by bicycle among people 12 years of age and older, for a cycling hospitalisation rate of 622 per 100 million trips (95\% CI 611 to 633). Hospitalisation rates varied substantially across the jurisdiction, age and sex strata, but only two characteristics explained this variability. For all injury causes, sex was associated with hospitalisation rates; females had rates consistently lower than males. For traffic-related injury causes, higher cycling mode share was consistently associated with lower hospitalisation rates. Helmet legislation was not associated with hospitalisation rates for brain, head, scalp, skull, face or neck injuries.Conclusions These results suggest that transportation and health policymakers who aim to reduce bicycling injury rates in the population should focus on factors related to increased cycling mode share and female cycling choices. Bicycling routes designed to be physically separated from traffic or along quiet streets fit both these criteria and are associated with lower relative risks of injury.},

 abstract = {Transportation engineers are taught that as demand for travel goes up, this decreases not only speed but also the capacity of the road system, a phenomenon known as hypercongestion. We revisit this idea. There is no question that road systems experience periods in which capacity falls. However, we point out that capacity is determined by both demand and supply. Road construction, lane closures, stalled vehicles, weather, and other supply shocks provide an alternative explanation for the empirical evidence on hypercongestion. Using data from the Caldecott Tunnel in Oakland, California, we show that a naive regression recovers the standard hypercongestion result in the literature. However, once we use instrumental variables to isolate the effect of travel demand this effect disappears and across specifications we find no evidence that capacity decreases during periods of high demand. This lack of evidence of hypercongestion calls into question long-standing conventional wisdom held by transportation engineers and implies that efficient “Pigouvian” congestion taxes should be substantially lower than implied by hypercongestion models.},

In studies, people correctly identified liars only 47 percent of the time - less than random chance.

  abstract={In this study of how off-street parking requirements affect urban form, we begin by analyzing the relationship between population density and streets in cities. We find that denser cities devote a greater share of their land to streets, but also have less street space per person. This relationship results in part from the difficulty of constructing new streets in built-out areas. The amount of street space does not increase as fast as population density, and this in turn helps explain why dense areas have less vehicle travel per person but higher levels of congestion. In contrast to streets, new off-street parking is supplied continually, owing largely to minimum parking requirements that make new development contingent on the provision of parking spaces. But the ample supply of off-street parking makes traffic congestion worse and inhibits street life. We recommend either removing off-street parking requirements, or converting them from minimums to maximums.},

  date={2017-04-04},
  comment={Covers the developments in British rail, particularly communter rail into London, which has tried to privatize rail ownership. This has resulted in delays, strikes, and expensive service. British taxpayers spend far more on the privatized system than they did on the old nationalized model. ``Considering all the humiliating failures, why have successive governments — both Conservative and New Labour — continued to pursue privatization with such unbending zeal? In short, to undermine organized labor.''},
  category={Transportation, trains, rail service, unions, great britain, london, labor}
}
% The details actually sugest that privitization isn't as much the problem as the public-private partnership:
% "The privatizers claimed that competition would lift standards of service, put the needs of the consumer first, reduce the burden on the taxpayer, rid the system of inefficiencies and drive down prices. On all scores, the privatization of Britain’s railways is an embarrassment. Look no further than the current dispute on Southern to see how dysfunctional the privatized system is.  Govia is contracted to run the Southern franchise — and is paid about £1 billion (or $1.24 billion), a year by the government to do so. In return, revenue from ticket sales goes directly back to the government. Yet if train services are delayed or canceled, it is the government — or rather, the taxpayer — that refunds the bitter commuters. The company itself therefore has no incentive to settle with the unions; arguably, it is being paid by the Tory government to keep up the fight. Yet the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, pretends to have no hand in the matter, saying he cannot “wave a wand” to resolve the dispute."
% This whole fiasco serves as a general warning against privitization, sure.
% But it also shows that public-private partnership setups can be very complicated to make them work correctly. Basic economic motives can undermine the goals of such partnerships if they aren't built right.
% Could those be corrected? Maybe. But it sure seems easier to avoid complicated, possibly corrupt, partnership setups by just going with completely publicly funded service from the getgo.

Now it would require Breezewood to give up their tourist trap and propose a connecting ramp to fix it. Which isn't going to happen since the town is economically dependent on the setup.},

abstract = { ABSTRACTIdentifying and measuring the land value uplift (LVU) impacts of rapid transit are important for a number of reasons. However, despite the general notion that rapid transit does confer positive LVU benefits, our comprehensive and critical review of more than 130 analyses across 60 studies completed in North America over the past 40 years finds significant heterogeneity in research outcomes, leaving many significant questions unanswered. Beyond high-level differences in study inputs, we argue that a fundamental source of variability is a lack of empirical specificity from the use of proximity as the dominant way in which LVU benefits are captured. This use of a proxy leads to the potential for omitted variables and unobserved relationships, and exposes previous work to the potential for misvalued results. To overcome this issue, we outline recommendations for future research, namely a recognition of relative accessibility and the possibility of LVU impacts from transit-oriented development. Incorporating measures related to these factors into LVU models can reveal their implicit prices, resulting in research that is more theoretically inclusive, empirically comprehensive, comparable, and able to provide important information to inform policy analysis and prescription. },
comment = {Transit is often funded by borrowing against the future increased value of property taxes near new transit. This paper suggests that is a flawed approach because land values actually only go up in certain neighborhoods. (Like far-flung traffic-congested neighborhoods.) Also, it appears that much of increased land value is actually from neighborhood ``improvements'' in general (read: gentrification) of which transit access may only play a tiny part.},

% As usual, I can't actually access this paper. Read about it here: \url{http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/04/transit-station-property-value-study/479730/}
% It sounds like the paper discusses the physical/plannery improvements of a neighborhood (like "Transit Oriented Development") and how those physical improvements might drive up land value despite transit improvements, not because of them.
% But it reveals the fundamental flaw in the economin analysis part of the planning field: planning always assumes a neighborhood is the same people, or that the people who live in a neighborhood don't matter as much as the economic measures. So a city is more interested in increasing property values than anything else, in order to have a higher tax base. But that ignores the fact that a higher tax base is almost certainly a reflection of _different_ people living in a neighborhood.

The remaining one-third appears to have been captured by blenders, as we find no evidence that oil refiners or gasoline consumers captured any part of the subsidy.

In this paper,  we de- scribe ‘Streetscore’, a scene understanding algorithm that predicts the perceived safety of a streetscape, using training data  from  an  online  survey  with  contributions  from  more than 7000 participants.  We first study the predictive power of commonly used image features using support vector regression,  finding  that  Geometric  Texton  and  Color  Histograms along with GIST are the best performers when it comes to predict the perceived safety of a streetscape.  Using Streetscore, we create high resolution maps of perceived safety  for  21  cities  in  the  Northeast  and  Midwest  of  the United  States  at  a  resolution  of  200  images/square  mile, scoring 1 million images from Google Streetview.

Uconnect, an Internet-connected computer feature in hundreds of thousands of Fiat Chrysler cars, SUVs, and trucks, controls the vehicle’s entertainment and navigation, enables phone calls, and even offers a Wi-Fi hot spot.'' ``From that entry point, Miller and Valasek’s attack pivots to an adjacent chip in the car’s head unit—the hardware for its entertainment system—silently rewriting the chip’s firmware to plant their code. That rewritten firmware is capable of sending commands through the car’s internal computer network, known as a CAN bus, to its physical components like the engine and wheels.

  abstract = {The wide adoption of self-driving, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) promises to dramatically reduce the number of traffic accidents. Some accidents, though, will be inevitable, because some situations will require AVs to choose the lesser of two evils. For example, running over a pedestrian on the road or a passer-by on the side; or choosing whether to run over a group of pedestrians or to sacrifice the passenger by driving into a wall. It is a formidable challenge to define the algorithms that will guide AVs confronted with such moral dilemmas. In particular, these moral algorithms will need to accomplish three potentially incompatible objectives: being consistent, not causing public outrage, and not discouraging buyers. We argue to achieve these objectives, manufacturers and regulators will need psychologists to apply the methods of experimental ethics to situations involving AVs and unavoidable harm. To illustrate our claim, we report three surveys showing that laypersons are relatively comfortable with utilitarian AVs, programmed to minimize the death toll in case of unavoidable harm. We give special attention to whether an AV should save lives by sacrificing its owner, and provide insights into (i) the perceived morality of this self-sacrifice, (ii) the willingness to see this self-sacrifice being legally enforced, (iii) the expectations that AVs will be programmed to self-sacrifice, and (iv) the willingness to buy self-sacrificing AVs. },

And this coverage at MIT: \url{http://www.technologyreview.com/view/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/} which points out that because self-driving cars are so much safer in general, you create a moral dillemma if you choose not to purchase one that would sacrifice you, because your dangerous driving puts more people at risk.},

  journal={The Atlantic},
  date={2015-11-13},
  comment = {The reason NYC subways mostly lack countdown clocks are complex and deep. There's three major competing systems half-implemented on different parts of the subway system. One of which aims to replace most of the old mechanical control system with software - ``The bulk of the system’s complexity is moved into software: software that interfaces with the physical train controls; software that understands the entire system’s track layout, including all switches, grades, and stations; and software with a huge number of rules about what kind of movements are allowed when.'' This article includes a nice basic introduction to how train control works. See also this graphic from Time Out about the length and ridership on subways worldwide: \url{http://www.timeout.com/newyork/travel/infograph-the-nyc-subway-versus-subways-around-the-world} ``Having full-time software experts running the show turned out to be crucial. Previous incarnations of the project didn’t have a technical leader at the MTA—just old-school senior managers who would try to wrangle the contractors by force of will. The new in-house team, by contrast, was qualified to define exactly what they wanted from software providers in terms those providers could understand. They were qualified to evaluate progress. They could sniff out problems early.''  ``I keep thinking of Healthcare.gov. Everyone knows that the initial project was a costly disaster, but less well known is that a small team came along and saved it. The story includes this remarkable fact: The old system cost 250 million to build and 70 million a year to maintain. The new system—which actually worked—cost about 4 million to build; its yearly maintenance was about 1 million.''},

% "At 40 feet, their face would engorge with blood. The blood vessels in their eyes would burst and bodily fluids would shoot from their orifices. Then they would hear a sickening swish at the back of the dive helmet—this was the sound of their hair being sucked off their scalp. At extreme depths, their face would rip from their head and be deposited back through the air hose on deck in a bloody spurt."
% This story reminds us that underwater is really no environment for humans.
% I've had the thought before that while many enviornments on earth, even the far north, are places humans can adapt to living, underwater, the antarctic, and space are all environments that are so far outside our safe experience that they can only be ventured into with support from other places.

There are no space colonies that are producing their own food and supplies and living their sustainably. There's no undersea colonies or even Antarctic colonies either. (The Antarctic colonies, of course, entirely depend on shipments from the mainland, and produce nothing that could even be traded economically for those shipments.

  comment = {Two months of protesting, including a hunger strike, did nothing to change the University of Missouri's approach to racial slurs. But 36 hours after the football team threatened to strike, the president of the university resigned. ``It turns out that the football players had something the other protesters didn’t: power. There wasn’t the slightest hint that Wolfe was considering resigning — until the football players got involved. Schwarz, the economist, told me that it was easy for the university administration to ignore the protesters because they were members of minorities and because they were young. But, he added, “The one place where young minority voices have economic power is sports.”''},

% Once again it is shown: protesting does little or nothing (except possibly raise awareness). People in power only fear economic repercussions or violence. And since the left wing abhors violence, we are left only with the occasional football player to change things.
% another interesting corollary here is the Keystone Pipeline which Obama just rejected. It too was protested for years. And the protests did apparently nothing. But as soon as the price of oil fell, Obama denied the permit.
% See also this On The Media spot: \url{https://www.wnyc.org/story/power-protest}
% Where a political science researcher talks about finding that the easier it is to do an action, the less representatives are affected by it.
% So since it is easy to put a protest together now, it gets less attention. Same for emails or phone calls. There is diminishing returns to ENCOURAGING people to call their representatives.
% It is still hard to get people to show up at representative's office though...
% And suggested in here is that taking the risk of violent action is something that REALLY gets attention
% because it is a hard thing to get people to do.
% Though this feels a little like she's talking out both sides of her mouth:
% It's too easy to get people to show up for marches, so those don't work,
% But it's too hard to get people to show up at rep's offices, so those do?
% Seems like both of those are about the same lift for people to me.
% I think really what happens is reps are human and get fatigued and numbed to things they see all the time.

Flexibility is still considered one of the five "major components" of physical fitness, alongside body composition, cardiovascular endurance, muscle endurance, and muscle strength. In reality, studies have repeatedly shown that flexibility does nothing for one's health and it does not improve one's sports performance (unless you are a gymnast). It is also not related to non-sports problems like lower back pain. Stretching before, during, or after a workout does nothing to prevent muscle soreness or reduce injury. In fact, there is evidence that holding a stretch DECREASES strength and speed for up to an hour. For some folks who like being flexibile, there's probably little harm in it. But there is no way it is related to overall health.},

  journal={Scientific American},
  date={2020-02-12},
  comment={Despite a quarte of a trillion dollars spent since Nixon declared a 'war on cancer' in 1971, and all the hype surrounding cancer research and science, 600,000 people still die every year of the disease. Adjusting for aging populations (that is, putting cancer healthcare in a more favorable light because more people are living longer to die of cancer) mortality rates from cancer have declined 30 percent since 1991. But 1991 follows 60 years of _increases_ --- the current mortality rate for all cancers is just under what it was in _1930_. The increases came with the increase in smoking. The fall came with the reduction of smoking. We are simply back to where we started, in terms of mortality numbers. "without reductions in smoking there would have been virtually no reduction in overall cancer mortality in either men or women since the early 1990s." "Clinical cancer trials have the highest failure rate compared with other therapeutic areas," "72 new anticancer drugs approved by the FDA between 2004 and 2014 prolonged survival for an average of 2.1 months. A 2017 report concluded that most cancer drug approvals have not been shown to, or do not, improve clinically relevant end points, including survival and quality of life. The authors worried that the FDA may be approving many costly, toxic drugs that do not improve overall survival.”  "A 2015 meta-analysis by epidemiologist John Ioannidis (renowned for bringing the scientific replication crisis to light) and others found no reductions in all-cause mortality from tests for cancer of the breast, prostate, colon, lung, cervix, mouth or ovaries for asymptomatic patients." "Studies of tests for a specific cancer generally look at mortality attributed to that cancer. Mammograms are thus deemed effective if women who get mammograms die less often from breast cancer than women who do not get mammograms. This method can overstate the benefits of tests, because it might omit deaths resulting, directly or indirectly, from the diagnosis. After all, surgery, chemotherapy and radiation can have devastating iatrogenic effects, including heart disease, opportunistic infections, other forms of cancer and suicide."  "A 2015 analysis points out, in general people do not live longer as a result of early detection. They simply live longer with a diagnosis of cancer, with all its harmful emotional, economic and physiological consequences." Solution: "In “The Case for Being a Medical Conservative," a manifesto published last year, four physicians (including the aforementioned Vinay Prasad) urge colleagues to recognize the human body’s “inherent healing properties" and to acknowledge “how little effect the clinician has on outcomes.” Physicians will thus protect themselves “against our greatest foe—hubris.”},

In this paper we study how ED doctors respond to such incentives, by focussing on a landmark policy in England that imposed strong incentives to treat ED patients within four hours. Using bunching techniques, we estimate that the policy reduced affected patients’ wait times by 19 minutes, yet distorted a number of medical decisions. In response to the policy, doctors increased the intensity of ED treatment and admitted more patients for costly inpatient care. We also find a striking 14% reduction in mortality. To determine the mechanism behind these health improvements, we exploit heterogeneity in patient severity and hospital crowding, and find strongly suggestive evidence that it is the reduced wait times, rather than the additional admits, that saves lives. Overall we conclude that, despite distorting medical decisions, constraining ED doctors can induce cost-effective reductions in mortality.},

PURPOSE: The present cross-sectional study (n = 37,570) examined the associations of driving time with a series of health behaviors and outcomes in a large population sample of middle-aged and older adults using data from the Social, Economic, and Environmental Factor Study conducted in New South Wales, Australia, in 2010. METHODS: Multiple logistic regression was used in 2013 to examine the associations of usual daily driving time with health-related behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep) and outcomes (obesity, general health, quality of life, psychological distress, time stress, social functioning), adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Findings suggested that longer driving time was associated with higher odds for smoking, insufficient physical activity, short sleep, obesity, and worse physical and mental health. The associations consistently showed a dose-response pattern and more than 120 minutes of driving per day had the strongest and most consistent associations with the majority of outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study highlights driving as a potential lifestyle risk factor for public health. More population-level multidisciplinary research is needed to understand the mechanism of how driving affects health.},

This relationship is driven by sunlight in late summer and early fall, when there are sufficient quantities of both sunlight and influenza activity. A 10% increase in relative sunlight decreases the influenza index in September by 3 points on a 10-point scale. This effect is far greater than the effect of vitamin D supplementation in randomized trials, a differential due to broad exposure to sunlight, hence herd immunity.

The US is the only country that continues to experience these tragedies without cracking down the availability of guns. ``“In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”''},

There is more and more research that suggests that this understanding, similar to ecological understandings of invasive species on environments (like zebra mussels in the great lakes) is a far more accurate way to understand cancer (and any disease, really). Experiments show that the same cancer injected into different mice strains will have different results. But doctors are in a mindset of focussing on cancer cells alone. They don't want to be told its even more complex than it already is. The medical industry likes results that are black and white, good and bad cells, on and off, positive and negative tests.},

  comment={In the United States, almost 4,000 persons die from drowning each year. Drowning is responsible for more deaths among children aged 1–4 years than any other cause except congenital anomalies. For persons aged ≤29 years, drowning is one of the top three causes of unintentional injury death. Previous research has identified racial/ethnic disparities in drowning rates. To describe these differences by age of decedent and drowning setting, CDC analyzed 12 years of combined mortality data from 1999–2010 for those aged ≤29 years. Among non-Hispanics, the overall drowning rate for American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) was twice the rate for whites, and the rate for blacks was 1.4 times the rate for whites. Disparities were greatest in swimming pools, with swimming pool drowning rates among blacks aged 5–19 years 5.5 times higher than those among whites in the same age group. This disparity was greatest at ages 11–12 years; at these ages, blacks drown in swimming pools at 10 times the rate of whites. Drowning prevention strategies include using barriers (e.g., fencing) and life jackets, actively supervising or lifeguarding, teaching basic swimming skills and performing bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The practicality and effectiveness of these strategies varies by setting; however, basic swimming skills can be beneficial across all settings.},

Together, these results suggest that using money to buy time can protect people from the detrimental effects of time pressure on life satisfaction.},

Since the first description of the ‘Monosodium glutamate symptom complex’, originally described in 1968 as the ‘Chinese restaurant syndrome’, a number of anecdotal reports and small clinical studies of variable quality have attributed a variety of symptoms to the dietary ingestion of MSG. Descriptions of MSG-induced asthma, urticaria, angio-oedema, and rhinitis have prompted some to suggest that MSG should be an aetiologic consideration in patients presenting with these conditions. This review prevents a critical review of the available literature related to the possible role of MSG in the so-called ‘Chinese restaurant syndrome’ and in eliciting asthmatic bronchospasm, urticaria, angio-oedema, and rhinitis. Despite concerns raised by early reports, decades of research have failed to demonstrate a clear and consistent relationship between MSG ingestion and the development of these conditions.},

abstract = { Aims:To review the burden of allergic and infectious diseases and the evidence for a link to microbial exposure, the human microbiome and immune system, and to assess whether we could develop lifestyles which reconnect us with exposures which could reduce the risk of allergic disease while also protecting against infectious disease.Methods:Using methodology based on the Delphi technique, six experts in infectious and allergic disease were surveyed to allow for elicitation of group judgement and consensus view on issues pertinent to the aim.Results:Key themes emerged where evidence shows that interaction with microbes that inhabit the natural environment and human microbiome plays an essential role in immune regulation. Changes in lifestyle and environmental exposure, rapid urbanisation, altered diet and antibiotic use have had profound effects on the human microbiome, leading to failure of immunotolerance and increased risk of allergic disease. Although evidence supports the concept of immune regulation driven by microbe–host interactions, the term ‘hygiene hypothesis’ is a misleading misnomer. There is no good evidence that hygiene, as the public understands, is responsible for the clinically relevant changes to microbial exposures.Conclusion:Evidence suggests a combination of strategies, including natural childbirth, breast feeding, increased social exposure through sport, other outdoor activities, less time spent indoors, diet and appropriate antibiotic use, may help restore the microbiome and perhaps reduce risks of allergic disease. Preventive efforts must focus on early life. The term ‘hygiene hypothesis’ must be abandoned. Promotion of a risk assessment approach (targeted hygiene) provides a framework for maximising protection against pathogen exposure while allowing spread of essential microbes between family members. To build on these findings, we must change public, public health and professional perceptions about the microbiome and about hygiene. We need to restore public understanding of hygiene as a means to prevent infectious disease. },

% Of course the devil is in the details of a proposal like this, particularly what counts as "catastrophic."
% But it's a good idea in that even if a poor number of things qualified under Trump, it could be expanded lated when the Democrats are back in power to become something more like universal single-payer.
% The other thing I like about this is it would encourage young people to start small businesses, or work for small businesses that can't afford health benefits. They could take the risk of working for themselves, (and not getting sick) without worrying about some accident bankrupting them.
% Conservatives SHOULD like that about universal coverage too, though you never see them argue it (including in this op-ed).

Secondary outcomes were adverse effects, patient adherence, and use of rescue medication. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability). We calculated weighted mean differences or risk ratios and 95\% confidence intervals using a random effects model. The Cochrane Collaboration{\textquoteright}s tool was used for assessing risk of bias, and the GRADE approach was used to evaluate the quality of evidence and summarise conclusions.Results 12 reports (13 randomised trials) were included. There was {\textquotedblleft}high quality{\textquotedblright} evidence that paracetamol is ineffective for reducing pain intensity (weighted mean difference -0.5, 95\% confidence interval -2.9 to 1.9) and disability (0.4, -1.7 to 2.5) or improving quality of life (0.4, -0.9 to 1.7) in the short term in people with low back pain.

The number of patients reporting any adverse event (risk ratio 1.0, 95\% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.1), any serious adverse event (1.2, 0.7 to 2.1), or withdrawn from the study because of adverse events (1.2, 0.9 to 1.5) was similar in the paracetamol and placebo groups. Patient adherence to treatment (1.0, 0.9 to 1.1) and use of rescue medication (0.7, 0.4 to 1.3) was also similar between groups. {\textquotedblleft}High quality{\textquotedblright} evidence showed that patients taking paracetamol are nearly four times more likely to have abnormal results on liver function tests (3.8, 1.9 to 7.4), but the clinical importance of this effect is uncertain.Conclusions Paracetamol is ineffective in the treatment of low back pain and provides minimal short term benefit for people with osteoarthritis.

% This article describes the concept of the "default-mode network" which is, I believe what I call daydreaming, letting one's mind wander. This is in contrast to being on task or "flow". Meditation (and ayahuasca) are about shutting down both of those modes and tapping a different consciousness. Which I am sure is important to our mental health. 
(Though I strongly suspect that meditiation is far less necessary if people got more and better sleep. Think about it - meditation frees you to connect to your subconscious, but while awake, to try and make connections and achieve deeper realizations about your life. Is this not exactly what sleep scientists think sleep does?)
I'm not so much interested in the point where you shut down daydreaming and task orientation both. I'm interested in the point where those two things intersect. For example, daydreaming is very strong while riding my bicycle, but then when I sit down to write about my daydreaming thoughts, (in task/flow mode) I often lose critical details. Is it possible that the reason so many great writers and creators were doing drugs has less to do with tapping subconscious, and more to do with connecting daydreaming to flow? If you are on heroine, maybe it allows you to be in task mode AND daydream at the same time. Or connects the two together into one.
How could I achieve that? Heroine, maybe. But perhaps it's the ability to record thoughts while in daydream mode? (A tape recorder on a bicycle?) Or a space where you can be in task mode, writing, but stand up and walk in daydream mode?

Junk food is cheap and plentiful largely because of these subsidies. Meanwhile very little subsidy goes to small farmers who produce fruit and nuts (regarded by the government as ``specialty crops''). Federal health researches have just put out a report looking at the link between metabolic disease and federally subsidized foods. ``The researchers found that those who had the highest consumption of federally subsidized foods had a 37 percent greater risk of being obese. They were also significantly more likely to have belly fat, abnormal cholesterol, and high levels of blood sugar and CRP, a marker of inflammation.''

  journal={The Guardian},
  date={2016-04-07},
  comment = {A long-form article about the history of the nutrition science studying dietary guidelines for sugar versus fat intake. Discusses how science is not a process of convincing people of empirical evidence but in fact a political process. The nutritionists of the 1960s and 1970s lampooned a mild-natured scientist named John Yudkin for saying sugar was what made people fat. ``We tend to think of heretics as contrarians, individuals with a compulsion to flout conventional wisdom. But sometimes a heretic is simply a mainstream thinker who stays facing the same way while everyone around him turns 180 degrees.'' ``In a 2015 paper titled Does Science Advance One Funeral at a Time?, a team of scholars at the National Bureau of Economic Research sought an empirical basis for a remark made by the physicist Max Planck: “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”'' ``A scientist is part of what the Polish philosopher of science Ludwik Fleck called a “thought collective”: a group of people exchanging ideas in a mutually comprehensible idiom. The group, suggested Fleck, inevitably develops a mind of its own, as the individuals in it converge on a way of communicating, thinking and feeling.  This makes scientific inquiry prone to the eternal rules of human social life: deference to the charismatic, herding towards majority opinion, punishment for deviance, and intense discomfort with admitting to error. Of course, such tendencies are precisely what the scientific method was invented to correct for, and over the long run, it does a good job of it. In the long run, however, we’re all dead, quite possibly sooner than we would be if we hadn’t been following a diet based on poor advice.''},

Bringing up the rear were Americans at 6.5 hours and Japanese at 6.4.'' ``Sleeping hours are disproportionate across the socioeconomic spectrum as well. The more you make, the less you sleep. Almost half of people earning less than 30,000 a year sleep at least six hours a night, compared with about a third of those earning at least 75,000.'' ``Americans also sleep less than we used to. In 1942, almost 85 percent of us slept at least seven hours a night. Today, less than 60 percent of us do.'' ``Not getting enough sleep is a big problem. Randomized controlled trials show that people who are sleep-deprived can see decreases in their empathy. More than one such study has shown that sleep deprivation can leave people more sensitive to pain. Sleep deprivation can hurt cognition, and it is associated with many, many car accidents.'' ``But serious sleep deprivation in adults is most likely rarer than many think it is\ldots Many news reports that highlight the dangers from too little sleep are assuming that all adults need at least eight hours. There’s just little evidence that’s so.'' (Except for children.) ``A study published in 2014 examined 9,000 students in eight public schools in three states. It found that in high schools where classes began at 7:30 a.m., about a third of children got at least eight hours of sleep a night. If they started at 8:35 a.m., about 60 percent of children achieved that goal.'' ``It’s for reasons like these that the American Academy of Pediatrics released a policy statement in 2014 calling for a shift in school start times to 8:30 or later.

The tentative conclusion is that economic crises affect mortality rates (and presumably other measures of health) in the same way as less severe downturns: namely, they lead to improvements in physical health. The effects of severe national recessions in the United States, appear to have a beneficial effect on mortality that is roughly twice as strong as that predicted due to the elevated unemployment rates alone while the higher predicted rate of suicides during typical periods of economic weakness is approximately offset during severe recessions. No consistent pattern is obtained for more localized economic crises occurring at the state level – some estimates suggest larger protective mortality effects while others indicate offsetting deleterious consequences.},

The sample is the set of full-year uninsured persons represented in the Current Population Survey for the pre-ACA period with incomes above 138 percent of the federal poverty level.  The estimated change in financial burden compares out-of-pocket payments by income stratum in the pre-ACA period with the sum of premiums (net of subsidy) and expected  cost sharing (net of subsidy) for benchmark Silver and Bronze plans, under various assumptions about the extent of increased spending associated with obtaining coverage.  In addition to changes in the financial burden, our welfare estimates incorporate the value of additional care consumed and the change in risk premiums for changes in exposure to out-of-pocket payments associated with coverage, under various assumptions about risk aversion.  We find that the average financial burden will increase for all income levels once insured.  Subsidy-eligible persons with incomes below 250 percent of the poverty threshold likely experience welfare improvements that offset the higher financial burden, depending on assumptions about risk aversion and the value of additional consumption of medical care.  However, even under the most optimistic assumptions, close to half of the formerly uninsured (especially those with higher incomes) experience both higher financial burden and lower estimated welfare; indicating a positive “price of responsibility” for complying with the individual mandate.  The percentage of the sample with estimated welfare increases is close to matching observed take-up rates by the previously uninsured in the exchanges.},

  abstract = {In 2011, one in three women who gave birth in the United States did so by cesarean delivery. Cesarean birth can be life-saving for the fetus, the mother, or both in certain cases. However, the rapid increase in cesarean birth rates from 1996 to 2011 without clear evidence of concomitant decreases in maternal or neonatal morbidity or mortality raises significant concern that cesarean delivery is overused. Variation in the rates of nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex cesarean births also indicates that clinical practice patterns affect the number of cesarean births performed. The most common indications for primary cesarean delivery include, in order of frequency, labor dystocia, abnormal or indeterminate (formerly, nonreassuring) fetal heart rate tracing, fetal malpresentation, multiple gestation, and suspected fetal macrosomia. Safe reduction of the rate of primary cesarean deliveries will require different approaches for each of these, as well as other, indications. For example, it may be necessary to revisit the definition of labor dystocia because recent data show that contemporary labor progresses at a rate substantially slower than what was historically taught. Additionally, improved and standardized fetal heart rate interpretation and management may have an effect. Increasing women’s access to nonmedical interventions during labor, such as continuous labor and delivery support, also has been shown to reduce cesarean birth rates. External cephalic version for breech presentation and a trial of labor for women with twin gestations when the first twin is in cephalic presentation are other of several examples of interventions that can contribute to the safe lowering of the primary cesarean delivery rate.},

 abstract = {A large literature has analyzed pricing inefficiencies in health insurance markets due to adverse selection, typically assuming informed, active consumers on the demand side of the market. However, recent evidence suggests that many consumers have information frictions that lead to suboptimal health plan choices. As a result, policies such as information provision, plan recommendations, and smart defaults to improve consumer choices are being implemented in many applied contexts. In this paper we develop a general framework to study insurance market equilibrium and evaluate policy interventions in the presence of choice frictions. Friction-reducing policies can increase welfare by facilitating better matches between consumers and plans, but can decrease welfare by increasing the correlation between willingness-to-pay and costs, exacerbating adverse selection. We identify relationships between the underlying distributions of consumer (i) costs (ii) surplus from risk protection and (iii) choice frictions that determine whether friction-reducing policies will be on net welfare increasing or reducing. We extend the analysis to study how policies to improve consumer choices interact with the supply-side policy of risk-adjustment transfers and show that the effectiveness of the latter policy can have important implications for the effectiveness of the former. We implement the model empirically using proprietary data on insurance choices, utilization, and consumer information from a large firm. We leverage structural estimates from prior work with these data and highlight how the model's micro-foundations can be estimated in practice. In our specific setting, we find that friction-reducing policies exacerbate adverse selection, essentially leading to the market fully unraveling, and reduce welfare. Risk-adjustment transfers are complementary, substantially mitigating the negative impact of friction-reducing policies, but having little effect in their absence.},
 comment = {There is a bunch of research showing that consumers are making poor health plan choices because they don't have good information. This paper runs a model on whether policies that make choosing a plan easier help consumers in the long run, and comes to the conclusion (if I'm reading their insane econo-babble correctly) that in fact the consumer is making worse choices for themselves with policy-choice-helping systems.},

  comment = {Review of \emph{Beyond Obamacare : Life, Death, and Social Policy}. ``Being of African-American heritage confers worse health metrics in multiple domains, with much of the difference explained by differences in socioeconomic status. This is not to say that racism doesn’t cause poor health, but merely that it does so (in part) through socioeconomic pathways.[6] House argues that we should think about the social determinants of health using the now popular sociological framework of intersectionality, with economic, racial, and gender “axes” together playing a role in the production of health and disease. Indeed, the fact that the socioeconomically advantaged are as healthy as the residents of our peer nations helps buttress the point that, in America, there are indeed two interrelated inequalities at play — one of wealth and income, and the other of health. Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty have outlined the quantitative contours of the former with great clarity, but the latter has received far less attention in the public sphere. And yet, shouldn’t it be the contrary? Isn’t health more fundamental?'' ``The emerging picture, therefore, is not simply that poverty kills, which is true. Nor is it simply that there is a continuous gradient of health by income or education, which is also true. Both of these dynamics have presumably been at work, at least to some extent, in stratified human societies throughout history. The salient point is that within the past few decades, there seems to be a historic widening in the prospects for healthy living between those at the top of the economic pyramid and those below. Societal gains in both health and wealth are confined to those at the top, causing metrics of population health to experience a relative overall deterioration.''},

doi = {10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.017341}, 
abstract ={Background—The association between consumption of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and risk of mortality remains inconclusive.  Methods and Results—We examined the associations of consumption of total, caffeinated, and decaffeinated coffee with risk of subsequent total and cause-specific mortality among 74,890 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), 93,054 women in the NHS 2, and 40,557 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Coffee consumption was assessed at baseline using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. During 4,690,072 person-years of follow-up, 19,524 women and 12,432 men died. Consumption of total, caffeinated, and decaffeinated coffee were non-linearly associated with mortality. Compared to non-drinkers, coffee consumption one to five cups/d was associated with lower risk of mortality, while coffee consumption more than five cups/d was not associated with risk of mortality. However, when restricting to never smokers, compared to non-drinkers, the HRs of mortality were 0.94 (0.89 to 0.99) for ≤ 1 cup/d, 0.92 (0.87 to 0.97) for 1.1-3 cups/d, 0.85 (0.79 to 0.92) for 3.1-5 cups/d, and 0.88 (0.78 to 0.99) for > 5 cups/d (p for non-linearity = 0.32; p for trend < 0.001). Significant inverse associations were observed for caffeinated (p for trend < 0.001) and decaffeinated coffee (p for trend = 0.022). Significant inverse associations were observed between coffee consumption and deaths due to cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, and suicide. No significant association between coffee consumption and total cancer mortality was found.  Conclusions—Higher consumption of total coffee, caffeinated coffee, and decaffeinated coffee was associated with lower risk of total mortality. },

By contrast, reports of physical pain are strongly predictive of suicide in many contexts. The prevalence of pain is increasing among middle-aged Americans, and is accompanied by a substantial increase in suicides and deaths from drug and alcohol poisoning. Our measure of pain is now highest in middle age—when life evaluation and positive affect are at a minimum. In the absence of the pain epidemic, suicide and life evaluation are likely unrelated, leaving unresolved whether either one is a useful overall measure of population wellbeing.},

The results suggest that each additional uninsured person costs local hospitals 900 each year in uncompensated care. Similarly, the closure of a nearby hospital increases the uncompensated care costs of remaining hospitals. Increases in the uninsured population also lower hospital profit margins, which suggests that hospitals cannot simply pass along all increased costs onto privately insured patients. For-profit hospitals are less affected by these factors, suggesting that non-profit hospitals serve a unique role as part of the social insurance system.},

        abstract = {Spatial hearing is a crucial capacity of the auditory system. While the encoding of horizontal sound direction has
been extensively studied, very little is known about the representation of vertical sound direction in the auditory cortex. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured voxel-wise sound elevation tuning curves in human auditory cortex and show that sound elevation is represented by broad tuning functions preferring lower elevations as well as secondary narrow tuning functions preferring individual elevation directions. We changed the ear shape of participants (male and female) with silicone molds for several days. This manipulation reduced or abolished the ability to discriminate sound elevation and flattened cortical tuning curves. Tuning curves recovered their original shape as participants adapted to the modified ears and regained elevation perception over time. These
findings suggest that the elevation tuning observed in low-level auditory cortex did not arise from the physical features of the stimuli, but is contingent on experience with spectral cues and covaries with the change in perception. One explanation for this observation
may be that the tuning in low-level auditory cortex underlies the subjective perception of sound elevation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis study addresses two fundamental questions about the brain representation of sensory stimuli: how the vertical spatial axis of auditory space is represented in the auditory cortex, and whether low-level sensory cortex represents physical stimulus features or subjective perceptual attributes. Using high-resolution fMRI we show that vertical sound direction is represented by broad tuning functions preferring lower elevations as well as secondary narrow tuning functions preferring individual elevation directions. In addition, we demonstrate that the shape of these tuning functions is contingent on experience with spectral cues and covaries with the change in perception, which may indicate that the tuning functions in low-level auditory cortex underlie the perceived elevation of a sound source.},

While there is a tradition of connecting popular music with sociology, this article posits a further resonance that is not so much theoretical as methodological. The article suggests that forms of contemporary popular music parallel key facets of ethnography, not simply in terms of sociological analysis, but with regard to popular music as an ethnographic resource, as ‘data’, and as the reflexive expression of Paul Willis’ conception of the ‘ethnographic imagination’; and the article argues that contemporary British hip-hop in the form of ‘grime’ is a potent exemplar. This is due to the resolutely cultural, spatial nature of grime music: a factor that marks out grime as a distinctive musical genre and a distinctive ethnographic form, as it is an experientially rooted music about urban locations, made from within those urban locations. },

Covers Kraftwerk's influential history, including being picked up by Afrika Bambaataa to create Planet Rock, and other modern pop songs. Also talks about their early history and shift from Krautrock into electronic music for everyone. ``What carried the retrospective, and kept it from being a period piece, was the sound. It was relatively quiet, as pop-music performance goes, and Hütter explained that it was like classical music for him; hearing detail was important, and there needed to be room for dynamic surges and drops. Hearing the rippling, atonal arpeggios of “Numbers” or the almost demure tootling of “Neon Lights” made it seem as if Kraftwerk’s influence on contemporary music might never end. Every fragment of language—“It’s in the air for you and me,” for instance—and every lullaby melody could be dropped, without change, into any modern pop song and sound appropriate to even the savviest listener.''},

% Also, as Frere-Jones points out, this show was the BEST sounding show I have ever been too. It was astonishingly crisp. There was SO much detail you could hear.
% It's one of the things I love about Kraftwerk; their production quality. They are one of the few bands I like that justify having expensive stereo equipment. Not that there's anything wrong with poor production. But high-quality production is its own art to be appreciated when it's there.

  comment = {Raises the claim that there is no such thing as music with universal appeal (that is a concept that arose only in the last few hundred years) and makes the argument that music is inherently powerful and just as easy to use for violence as for peace. ``To quote the standard platitudes, it has charms to soothe a savage breast; it is the food of love; it brings us together and sets us free. We resist evidence suggesting that music can cloud reason, stir rage, cause pain, even kill. Footnoted treatises on the dark side of music are unlikely to sell as well as the cheery pop-science books that tout music’s ability to make us smarter, happier, and more productive.'' ``A genre that enrages one person may have a placebo effect on another. A 2006 study by the psychologist Laura Mitchell, testing how music-therapy sessions can alleviate pain, found that a suffering person was better served by his or her “preferred music” than by a piece that was assumed to have innately calming qualities. In other words, music therapy for a heavy-metal fan should involve heavy metal, not Enya.'' ``Beginning in the nineteen-fifties, programs that trained American soldiers and intelligence operatives to withstand torture had a musical component; at one point, the playlist reportedly included the industrial band Throbbing Gristle and the avant-garde vocalist Diamanda Galás.'' ``The soldiers told Pieslak that they used music to strip themselves of empathy. One said that he and his comrades sought out a “predator kind of music.” Another, after admitting with some embarrassment that Eminem’s “Go to Sleep” (“Die, motherfucker, die”) was a “theme song” for his unit, said, “You’ve got to become inhuman to do inhuman things.” The most unsettling choice was Slayer’s “Angel of Death,” which imagines the inner world of Josef Mengele: “Auschwitz, the meaning of pain / The way that I want you to die.” Such songs are far removed from uplifting wartime propaganda like “Over There,” the patriotic 1917 tune by George M. Cohan. The image of soldiers prepping for a mission by listening to Metallica’s “One”—“Landmine has taken my sight . . . Left me with life in hell”—suggests the degree to which they, too, felt trapped in a malevolent machine.'' ``German thinkers in the idealist and Romantic tradition—Hegel, E.T.A. Hoffmann, and Schopenhauer, among others—sparked a drastic revaluation of music’s significance. It became the doorway to the infinitude of the soul, and expressed humanity’s collective longing for freedom and brotherhood. With the canonization of Beethoven, music became the vehicle of genius. Sublime as Beethoven is, the claim of universality blended all too easily with a German bid for supremacy. The musicologist Richard Taruskin, whose rigorously unsentimental view of Western music history anchors much recent work in the field, likes to quote a phrase ironically articulated by the historian Stanley Hoffman, who died last year: “There are universal values, and they happen to be mine.”''},

% In the paper magazine this article was called: The Sound of Hate
% There's a lot of interesting ideas in this article, but the central thesis is deeply flawed. I'm sure it's possible to use SOUND as a weapon --- to cause deafness presumably. That would not be different than using lasers to blind people. 
% But the ``weapons'' that use sounds are usually trying to be non-permanent damaging. And those seem to be not entirely effective. I'm not sure the Mosquito device to chase away teenagers isn't any less of a scam than the devices that are supposed to chase away actual mosquitoes.
% And the sound machines that are supposed to disperse crowds, I heard recently, were complete ineffective against Black Lives Matter protesters. And presumably didn't work very well against Occupy Wall Street either.
% And that is not MUSIC those machines just make sound. There is little to no evidence that MUSIC is in any way a more effective torture or violence device than NOISE. 
% I think the more truthful conclusion is that music you like IS soothing, and what you like is not universal. But there is very little evidence that music can be used AGAINST someone.

Some of his singles even took dead aim at those rivals. “Raspberry Beret” played like a funky, libidinous sendup of Bruce Springsteen’s Heartland road songs. (“I put her on the back of my bike/And we went riding/Down by Old Man Johnson’s farm.”) The astounding guitar work on the “Purple Rain” soundtrack seemed directed at Jackson, who had muscled up his music on hits like “Beat It.” The point was unmistakable: If Michael Jackson wanted a rip-roaring guitar solo, he had to corral Eddie Van Halen and pay him a generous day rate. Prince could peel off the solo himself, presumably in between orgies.''},

  comment={Something like 1.9 trillion dollars in art will be passed from baby boomers to younger generations in the coming decade. But tastes for art dictate the art market values, and it's not clear that younger people care that much about art --- particularly blue chip art --- and the value may drop off drastically in years ahead. ``wealthy people aged 70 and over now list art as their sixth most popular interest, passion or hobby. Art drops off the list among those aged under 70, with sports, technology and philanthropy the most popular interests among the under-50s.''

Haubegger also said the perception that such films are risky means they face more studio scrutiny from the outset.''},

  comment={* Tim Robinson made amazing hand-drawn maps of the areas around Galway. He then sort-of annotated those maps with these essays. * The A Connemara Fractal essay functions as a correction to a claim in his earlier essay Setting Foot on the Shores of Connemara that the coastline of a certain section might be more than 250 miles long if measured along all its intricate curves. However, he discovers that in fact the coastline is fractal in nature, and thus measuring a coastline that way essentially yields a measurement of infinity. So this essay starts from this very practical space and expands into a very accessible discussion of the what and _why_ of fractals (I've never really seen a "why" explanation of fractals before). He discovers that the coastline is neither 1 nor two dimensional, but is closer to something like 1.2 dimensions, (or 1 and a half if you go by Mandelbrot's original estimation.) This essay also veers off into a discussion of how stories (particularly of local spoken word tradition) are attached to the landscape, with a story of a town named for a large rock of quartz (put their by ancients) that looks like a horse grazing in a field. (This concept is akin to the way Adam Curtis talks about communities need to be in touch with their stories in that talk with Alan Moore.) He covers Patrick Pearce's fiction stories and how they reflect the landscape and the mythology of a free Ireland. * Place/Person/Book is about John Millington Synge who visited the Aran Islands at the turn of the 20th Century and wrote plays about the people there that were put on in London and Paris. * Listening to the Landscape draws out the significance of place names --- that they are bound up in this part of the world with the geology of the landscape and the stories the folks tell. It is, in fact, impossible to even understand Irish place names without going to look at the geology of the place and hearing the stories (again: Adam Curtis) that people tell about the place. * The final essay is called "Through Prehistoric Eyes" which argues that the placement of some boulders by Bronze Age inhabitants of the part of Ireland around Galway not only aligned with the sun setting between two mountains, but shows an aesthetic choice that transcends time, religion, and culture. He argues that the boulders could have been put anywhere along the line of the setting sun, but they chose the _only_ part of the landscape that _anyone_ would chose, because it aesthetically feels right. It is, essentially, the argument for the core of Modernism in art.},
  category={The Art, bronze age, ireland, modernism}
}
% Not just an argument for modernism, but perhaps the MOST convincing argument that there is some kind of univeral aesthetics inherent to humans that I have ever read.
% Those shared aesthetics would be deep down and fundamental, (and easily confused with making broad generalities that are really more about culture than not - say that classical music has universal appeal) but they may in fact be there, in the way that these peopel 4000 years ago chose the same site that any of us doing the same activity today would have chosen.
% Is there something about the move that they were making - a change to the _landscape_ - that could become a universal aesthetic gesture?
% Or that within the cultural requirement they had (that we don't understand why) of marking the line of the setting sun, that they were THEN (with that rule applied) put into a position of making an aesthetic choice, and it was at that moment, within those constraints of their culture, that they made a more fundamental universal choice for aesthetics?
% page 51 -- he references the hag predicting a loss in battle to the marching O'Briens:
"Quietly the broad-sworded warriors [of clan-Brian-Rua], many in number, in closest order, came hard by loch Rask; all together they looked on the shining mere, and there they saw the monstrous and distorted form of a lone ancient hideous hag that stooped over the bright loch's shore. The loathly creature's semblance was this: she was thatched with elf-locks foxy-grey and rough as heather, long as sea-wrack, inextricably tangled; had a bossy wrinkled foully ulcerated forehead; every hair of her eyebrows was like a strong fish-hook and, from under them, bleary dripping eyes peered with malignant fire between lids all rawly crimson-edged; she had a great blueish nose, flattened and wide, copiously and snortingly catarrhous; lips livid, white-rimmed, pustulous, that outwards turned up to her snout, and downwards to a stubby beard...  The crone had a cairn of heads, a pile of arms and legs, a load, of spoils, all which she rinsed and diligently washed, so that by her labour the water in its whole extension was covered with hair and gory brains."

Stein and Larry Miller’s Blueprint for Counter Education is one of the defining (but neglected) works of radical pedagogy of the Vietnam War era. Originally published as a boxed set by Doubleday in 1970, the book was accompanied by large graphic posters that could serve as a portable learning environment for a new process-based model of education, and a bibliography and checklist that map patterns and relationships between radical thought and artistic practices—from the modernist avant-gardes to postmodernism, from the Bauhaus to Black Mountain College, from Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin to Buckminster Fuller and Norman O. Brown—with Herbert Marcuse and Marshall McLuhan serving as points of anchorage. Blueprint for Counter Education thus serves as a vital synthesis of the numerous intellectual currents in the countercultural debate on the radical reform of schools, universities and ways of learning. To accompany this new facsimile edition of the book and posters, an 80-page booklet features a conversation with the original Blueprint creators, Maurice R. Stein, Larry Miller and designer Marshall Henrichs, as well as essays from Jeffrey Schnapp, Paul Cronin and notes on the design by Adam Michaels of Project Projects.''

% This article doesn't talk about this, but it suggests many of those things about forgeries that work: the museum WANTED to believe it was real. I think antinquers are particularly susceptible to this because they want to collect the things that reflect the story of history as they WANT to see it. This secretary had everything: from that area of Connecticut, a dramatic tale about civil war brothers, reflections of the power of preserving the union, even a faked bit of flag.

Here, we use a Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model of geographic profiling, a mathematical technique developed in criminology and finding increasing application within ecology and epidemiology, to analyse the spatial patterns of Banksy artworks in Bristol and London. The model takes as input the locations of these artworks, and calculates the probability of ‘offender’ residence across the study area. Our analysis highlights areas associated with one prominent candidate (e.g., his home), supporting his identification as Banksy. More broadly, these results support previous suggestions that analysis of minor terrorism-related acts (e.g., graffiti) could be used to help locate terrorist bases before more serious incidents occur, and provides a fascinating example of the application of the model to a complex, real-world problem. },

% There's some interesting stuff in this article, but the fundamental argument that this is BAD for film doesn't totally follow. It shows how its GOOD for TV. So if the fortunes of the moderately well-off filmmmakers eventually turn back their way (which seems likely to me, that's a market biding its time, not under permanent collapse) will this guy write the same article about the corresponding loss in quality of television?
% Besides that he references the 1997 Times article saying the cost of the average film has gone up to $60 million, and how ridiculous that seems now. But in adjusted dollars that's like $84 million, so it's not that big a jump. The biggest jump in film cost actually came in the early 1990s, but he doesn't address that.

The claim of negligence was based on the premise that an alternative (non-invasive) test should have been used because it carried a lower risk. The case raises a number of general and widely applicable concerns about the decision-making process within the medical profession, including the ethics of informed consent, patient care liabilities when errors are made, and the research problem of focusing on ‘true positives’ while ignoring ‘false positives’. An immediate concern is how best to present Bayesian arguments in such a way that they can be understood by people who would normally balk at mathematical equations. We feel it is possible to present purely visual representations of a non-trivial Bayesian argument in such a way that no mathematical knowledge or understanding is needed. The approach supports a wide range of alternative scenarios, makes all assumptions easily understandable and offers significant potential benefits to many areas of medical decision-making.}

% There's a whole meta-issue that is more or less not addressed in this article - these databases represent a fundamental failure of the intent of Creative Commons open-content licensing.
% It's sad because I (and many others) have encouraged people to make as much content freely available as they are willing and able to - and now that impulse comes back to bite us with dark privacy-violation overtones.
% Unfortunately, I feel like the Creative Commons people now face a reckoning, and the possibility that in some ways better privacy might equal a more strictly capitalistic sense of copyright and digital content ownership. A tragedy of the Creative Commons, if you will.

  comment={These researchers find that mindfulness meditation "a Buddhism-inspired practice in which you focus your mind entirely on the current moment" decreases the motivation of workers. This is because mindfulness makes a person more relaxed and calm, and at peace with the current status of things. Motivation generally arises from the desire the _change_ things, implying the person is not at peace. Their research finds that people who meditate are more relaxed and less at peace and therefore less productive. Similar to taking a nap during the work day, the worker might feel better, but not very inspired to do grunt work.},

 abstract = {Despite growing enthusiasm, there is little empirical evidence on how well energy efficiency investments work. Evidence is particularly lacking from low- and middle-income countries, despite a widespread view that these countries have many of the best opportunities. This paper evaluates a field experiment in Mexico in which a quasi-experimental sample of new homes was provided with insulation and other energy-efficient upgrades. A novel feature of our study is that we deploy large numbers of data loggers which allow us to measure temperature and humidity at high frequency inside homes. We find that the upgrades had no detectable impact on electricity use or thermal comfort, with essentially identical temperature and humidity levels in upgraded and non-upgraded homes. These results stand in sharp contrast to the engineering estimates that predicted up to a 26% decrease in electricity use. Part of the explanation is that air conditioner ownership is lower than expected, thus reducing the potential for reductions in energy use. In addition, we document that most households have their windows open on hot days, nullifying the thermal benefits of roof and wall insulation. Overall, we conclude that the benefits from these investments are unlikely to exceed the costs, which added $400-$500 USD to the cost of each home. Our results underscore the urgent need to fully incorporate socioeconomic conditions and human behavior into engineering models of energy use.},
 comment = {``Our results add to a growing number of analyses that find ex post energy savings well below engineering estimates. See, e.g., Davis et al. (2014); Levinson (2016); Fowlie et al.  (forthcoming). In our case, the differences stem from low penetration of air conditioning, one of the key sources of energy savings in the engineering estimates. In addition, we document that most households have windows open during the summer, making building insulation and the other energy-efficiency investments less effective than predicted by the model.''  ``our results point to the urgent need to fully incorporate socioeconomic conditions and human behavior into engineering models.''},

  comment={Argues that, while a college degree yields higher lifetime earnings for middle class students, it yields only the slightest amount higher for low-income students. The push for college degrees has yielded an oversupply of college-educated people, which means that many jobs which can be done without college training now require college degrees. This means that lack of a college degree is becoming a _punishment_ for people without them, rather than a reward for people with them. ``This distinction is more than semantic. It is key to understanding the growing chasm between educational attainment and life prospects. For most of us, it’s not our education that determines our employment trajectory but rather where that education positions us in relation to others.''},

  category={Criticality, native americans, heavy metal, prejudice, paranoia, police}
}

% The implication of the headline is that another woman on the tour called the  police because they were Native Americans. Reading the article it is clear that the kid wearing a "Cattle Decapitation" metal band shirt and being shy contributed more to having the police called than any other factor. But I think it's a fair guess this story would never have risen to the NY Times level if the brothers were not Native Americans.
% 
% Metalheads are not a protected class, but the police are called to confront them all the time based on nothing more than how they dress. There is prejudice against Muslims because of the perception that they are a terrorist threat, and there is (very rightly) a huge effort to address that prejudice. I think there's probably just as much prejudice against metalheads because of the perception that they might become an active shooter threat. But where is the effort to address this prejudice?

% It would be fascinating to have someone go ask these brothers why THEY thought the police were called on them. It's a chance to unpack the actual fears of the culture against the national narrative of fear.

Police figured out they could get around that with certain descriptions, like "the defendent dropped the drugs on the ground." (This became known as "dropsy" testifying.) The practice of lying under oath is so common that it is called "testilying" by many people.

  comment={An essay arguing that gay marriage is an assimilating move in the LGBT community. ``The evolution from ACT UP and Zen Hospice to state-sanctioned marriage is precisely analogous to gentrification --- the creative outliers do the heavy lifting, and when a certain level of safety has been achieved, the assimilationists move in, raise prices, and force out the agents of change. But while we recognize and make at least cosmetic efforts to address the darker aspects of gentrification, we have forgotten or marginalized the in-your-face, in-the-streets activists of the LGBT left.'' ``The legalization of same-sex vows is another step in the monetization of all human encounter. Under capitalism, love, like everything else that was once sacred, has become inextricably entangled with Social Security perks and property transfers and thirty-thousand-dollar weddings accompanied by prenuptial agreements written in anticipation of divorce. When its advocates spoke of marriage as a civil right, they were speaking not of love, which remains mercifully and always indifferent to the law, but of property—its smooth acquisition and tax-free disposition, the many advantages it affords, one might say, to the married.'' ``How is Earth’s situation today different from that of a person with ­AIDS in 1985? Capital, backed by a growing and ever more heavily armed police force trained to shoot, so thoroughly monitors and controls every expression of resistance that the violent demonstrations of the 1960s come helplessly to mind. Our current political crisis arouses a dark urge to respond to the rhetorical violence of Donald Trump with the literal violence it encourages. Would the Vietnam War have ended without riots on campuses? Would African Americans have made any progress without the burning of cities? Those events, and not World War II, challenge my commitment to nonviolence.''},

To make something sparkle requires tiny pieces of things, so whereever that is seen, it is a product that contains glitter. Scientists track animals by mixing glitter with their food and looking for sparkly feces. Plywood manufacturers mix in glitter to prevent counterfeiting. ``Because glitter is difficult to remove completely from an area into which it has been introduced, and because individual varieties can be distinguished under a microscope, it can serve as useful crime scene evidence; years ago the F.B.I. contacted Glitterex to catalog samples of its products.''

American children's educational output has grown steeply over the past 30 years. ``In 2013, an article appeared in The Atlantic with the title, “My Daughter’s Homework Is Killing Me.” The writer, Karl Taro Greenfeld, had attempted to complete the homework of his daughter, an eighth grader at a selective New York public school, to discover the exact nature of the labor that was keeping her up every night. He quickly found that he wasn’t prepared to keep up: Imagine if after putting in a full day at the office — and school is pretty much what our children do for a job — you had to come home and do another four or so hours of office work. . . . If your job required that kind of work after work, how long would you last?'' ``The sad truth, however, is that college admissions are designed to funnel young adults onto different tracks, not to validate hard work. A jump in the number of Harvard-caliber students doesn’t have a corresponding effect on the size of the school’s freshman class. Instead, it allows the university to become even more selective and to raise prices, to stock up on geniuses and rich kids. This is the central problem with an education system designed to create the most human capital possible: an increase in ability within a competitive system doesn’t advantage all individuals.'' ``If more human capital automatically led to a higher standard of living, this model could be the foundation for an American meritocracy. But millennials’ extra work hasn’t earned them the promised higher standard of living. By every metric, this generation is the most educated in American history, yet its members are worse off economically than their parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents. Every authority from moms to presidents told millennials to accumulate as much human capital as they could; they did, but the market hasn’t held up its end of the bargain. What gives?''},

In most states 95 percent of felony charges are plead. In most other countries plea bargains are not a common tool. Even after plea bargaining became common after the Civil War, it mostly could still be seen as honest, until the increasing crime of the 1980s led to stiffer sentences.

  comment={An interview with Mauricio Lim Miller, formerly of Asian Neighborhood Design - a community development organization in California. Lim Miller is pioneering a method of addressing poverty by collecting data from a group of low-income families to see who is doing things that are successful, and then sharing those successful moves back with the group. This creates social signaling --- families that see what other families do that works, want to try that too. Miller's program is called the Family Independence Initiative. He talks about how the war on poverty began as movements, then grew into programs. But many of those programs reinforce a paternalistic notion, and become programs that people avoid for the sense of indignity they bring. People who are at conferences on poverty don't represent themselves, they represent the success of a _program_ in order to justify funding for that program. He also talks about how hard it is to tell social workers that they might not actually be helping people. Miller wrote a book about it called The Alternative: Most of What You Believe About Poverty Is Wrong.},

% The Times article includes some interesting extra notes: "The relationship between religious belief and moral behavior is, in fact, not well understood. Some studies find that devout believers live more morally upright lives, compared with nonbelievers; others find no differences at all. The research is plagued by differing definitions of what moral behavior is and what constitutes true religious devotion (e.g., self-identification, or daily ritual?). Even the definition of nonbelief is a moving target: A person may identify as atheist, agnostic, “lapsed” or merely indifferent depending on his or her mood and understanding of those terms. The urge to impute beliefs, motives and mental states to mass murderers, moreover, is often misplaced, experts said. Some mass killers clearly commit atrocities because of their professed religious beliefs, like terrorists. But modern history’s register of assorted serial killers, spree shooters and other mortal predators is a rogue’s gallery of mostly male, aggrieved actors who are sometimes believers, sometimes not, and who half the time do not qualify for any specific psychiatric diagnosis, as disturbed as they are, according an analysis of more than 200 such killers by Dr. Michael Stone, a New York forensic psychiatrist.  A large number — perhaps 25 percent, in Dr. Stone’s estimation — showed evidence of paranoid schizophrenia, which is characterized by delusional thinking. Those delusions, often enough, are infused with religious symbolism."

% We're so used to horror that the genre has pushed out to surrealistic extremes like Human Centipede 2 - which seem to be made ONLY to challenge you to stomach it.
% Meanwhile nobody makes rape joke (other than the Eiger Sanction). Our films and TV treat rape as this horror reserved only for the most dramatic situations on film (think of all the murders in the Sopranos versus the one rape scene) and the sexual violence in our culture continues to rise.
% It just isn't as simple as she makes it out to be here.
% I remember reading a piece by a person who had a family member murdered, talking about how hard it was to see all the murder on TV and movies treated so nonchalantly, and how rape is never portrayed that way.
% I'm super sympathetic to that - but again, the murder rate continues its percipitous decline.
% Maybe it is because murder has entered this realm of fantasy, and in becoming a part of our cultural fantasy realm, it becomes LESS likely to be something to be carried out in reality?
% This is a possibility, though some might argue that for those few who slip between the fantasy and reality, it turns into real-life horror like school shootings.
% (However, despite the increased media coverage of shooting events like that, I've heard the totals are actually down.)
% It's also possible that most murder was previously the result of gang battles, and we are simply less likely to have small-scale internecine warfare like that as we get more connected wide-scale over the internet.

If that's so, why would we be trying to correct the word they are using? She had just argued they are using the wrong word because they are TRYING to talk about the external parts. Essentially the first half argues that people WANT to talk about external parts, but are using the wrong term. And in the second half that people DON'T want to talk about external parts.

  comment={Brooks argues here that there has been a shift in the generaly thinking of the culture, away from intellectuals and towards policy wonks. ``If you were a certain sort of ideas-oriented young person coming of age in the 20th century, it was very likely you would give yourself a label and join some movement. You’d call yourself a Marxist, a neoconservative, a Freudian, an existentialist or a New Deal liberal.'' ``People today seem less likely to give themselves intellectual labels or join self-conscious philosophical movements. Young people today seem more likely to have their worldviews shaped by trips they have taken, or causes they have been involved in, or the racial or ethnic or gender identity group they identify with.'' ``In his book, “The Ideas Industry,” Daniel W. Drezner says we’ve shifted from a landscape dominated by public intellectuals to a world dominated by thought leaders. A public intellectual is someone like Isaiah Berlin, who is trained to comment on a wide array of public concerns from a specific moral stance. A thought leader champions one big idea to improve the world — think Al Gore’s work on global warming.'' ``As Drezner puts it, intellectuals are critical, skeptical and tend to be pessimistic. Thought leaders are evangelists for their idea and tend to be optimistic.'' There used to be a sense that the very nature of society was up for grabs, but now public thinkers see themselves as legislative advisers. While public policy used to be guided by frameworks politicians operated in which was created by intellectuals, now the itellectuals simply provide policy guidance in an effort to change one thing.},

% This is super interesting, and STARTS to get at some themes I've noticed myself. But I don't think it is totally cooked.
% For one thing, I'm not sure that "intellectuals" is the right term for who public thinkers _are_.
% Second this implies that the nature of society may no longer be up for grabs. If so, does that mean we have conceded defeat to a nature of society? Say the social-capitalists have won?
% Or are we simply lacking people challenging the nature of society, and we should get back to that? (I believe that's what Brooks is saying.)

  Title={The Decline of Wikipedia},
  journal={MIT Technology Review},
  date={2013-10-22},
  comment={Covers the history of the rise of Wikipedia, and the decline in the last decade as aggressive old-school editors have made it hard for new people to start editing. Also caused partially by the efforts to cut down on vandalism. This has led to a sharp decline in the number of active editors. And a professionalization of those voluteer editors and at the same time a weak representation of articles from non-Western non-white perspectives. The volunteer editors themselves blame the lack of newbies on "policy creep" citing the 5000-word neutral point of view policy. There's also some thought given to the idea that the ideals of the early internet are fading or being lost: ``Indeed, larger cultural trends will probably make it a challenge to appeal to a broader section of the public. As commercial websites have risen to prominence, online life has moved away from open, self-governed crowdsourcing communities like the one that runs Wikipedia, says Clay Shirky, a professor in the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University. Shirky was one of the biggest boosters of an idea, popular during the previous decade, that the Web encouraged strangers to come together and achieve things impossible for a conventional organization. Wikipedia is proof there was some truth to that notion. But today’s Web is dominated by sites such as Facebook and Twitter, where people maintain personal, egocentric feeds. Outside specific settings like massive multiplayer games, relatively few people mingle in shared virtual space. Instead, they use mobile devices that are unsuited to complex creative work and favor neatly self-­contained apps over messier, interconnected Web pages. Shirky, who is an advisor to the Wikimedia Foundation, says people steeped in that model will struggle to understand how and why they should contribute to Wikipedia or any project like it. “Facebook is the largest participatory culture today, but their mode of participation is different,” he says. “It’s aggregating rather than collaborating.”'' Also compares Wikipedia to a public park: ``Gardner agrees that today’s Web is hostile to self-organized collective efforts, likening it to a city that has lost its public parks. “Our time is spent on an increasingly small number of increasingly large corporate sites,” she says. “We need more public space online.” In fact, Gardner is leaving the foundation at the end of the year in search of new projects to work on that very problem. She contends that even with all its troubles, Wikipedia is one of the Web’s few public parks that won’t disappear.''},

% Doesn't address the fact that so much of wikipedia is now edited by experts that it can be hard to read some articles for being too technical. I have thought for a long time that Wikipedia should have a policy of putting a plain-language description at the top of every article.
% Also, while it does say that the efforts to address vandalism were mostly successful, it generally subscribes to the criticism that Wikipedia is often wrong. Sure it is, but it deserves credit for how GOOD and RIGHT it is too.
% As I say, it is obviously a mistake to cite Wikipedia for your academic paper, but you are a fool to not check the wikipedia article about whatever subject you are researching.

  comment={From the peak year of big-data hype comes this critical piece that tells the tales of how during Hurricane Sandy tweet data had things to tell us about what people in Manhattan were experiencing, but harder-hit areas like the Rockaways were completely silent on Twitter with the lack of power. And how Boston was trying to find potholes with a smartphone app that detected them with accelerometers, but had to supplement that data with government vehicles driven in neighborhoods with low smartphone usage. ``We can think of this as a “signal problem”: Data are assumed to accurately reflect the social world, but there are significant gaps, with little or no signal coming from particular communities.'' ``Big data’s signal problems won’t disappear as the use of smartphones and other digital technologies increases. As the geographers Michael Crutcher and Matthew Zook noted after Hurricane Katrina, technologies are always differentially adopted, and “any divide in accessing digital technology is not a one-time event but a constantly moving target as new devices, software and cultural practices emerge.” As we move into an era in which personal devices are seen as proxies for public needs, we run the risk that already existing inequities will be further entrenched. Thus, with every big data set, we need to ask which people are excluded. Which places are less visible? What happens if you live in the shadow of big data sets?  This points to the next frontier: how to address these weaknesses in big data science. In the near term, data scientists should take a page from social scientists, who have a long history of asking where the data they’re working with comes from, what methods were used to gather and analyze it, and what cognitive biases they might bring to its interpretation (for more, see “Raw Data is an Oxymoron“).''},

"For most epicures, it is almost an article of faith that this will never happen, because food needs to be cooked with love, flair and passion. While this might conceivably be true at the very peak of culinary art, in most cases mechanisation is competing not against the artisanal best but against the human mean. So, even if the very best coffee is still made the traditional way by a skilled, human barista, all Nespresso need do is produce better coffee than the majority of baristas, whom most coffee fanatics describe as incompetent anyway." "Surely we appreciate the handmade in part because it is handmade. An object or a meal has different meaning and significance if we know it to be the product of a human being working skilfully with tools rather than a machine stamping out another clone. Even if in some ways a mass-produced object is superior in its physical properties, we have good reasons for preferring a less perfect, handcrafted one." "Corporations know this, which is why they will often use bogus personalisation to make their products seem more appealing, like putting a picture of a farmer on the label, or giving the product the name of a person or place. But do we have good reasons for this preference, or is it just romantic nonsense? I think we do.

Mass production, like factory farming, weakens, if not destroys, these relationships.

  comment={Argues that postmodernism did not say there is no truth, but that there is too much to know for any individual to think they know everything they need to. ``The point of postmodernism is not and was never “there are no facts”, the denial of an objective reality. The point is that facts are unevenly distributed across a metamedium which distributes half-facts and falsehoods with equal facility. The point is that the whole-truth-and-nothing-but-the-truth objective reality is by definition inaccessible to the subjective experience of individuals; there is far too much to know for any one individual to know it all. The point is that he who controls the distribution of stories controls the stories themselves.''

In the present study, the Arctic Ocean was extensively sampled for floating plastic debris from the Tara Oceans circumpolar expedition. Although plastic debris was scarce or absent in most of the Arctic waters, it reached high concentrations (hundreds of thousands of pieces per square kilometer) in the northernmost and easternmost areas of the Greenland and Barents seas. The fragmentation and typology of the plastic suggested an abundant presence of aged debris that originated from distant sources. This hypothesis was corroborated by the relatively high ratios of marine surface plastic to local pollution sources. Surface circulation models and field data showed that the poleward branch of the Thermohaline Circulation transfers floating debris from the North Atlantic to the Greenland and Barents seas, which would be a dead end for this plastic conveyor belt. Given the limited surface transport of the plastic that accumulated here and the
mechanisms acting for the downward transport, the seafloor beneath this Arctic sector is hypothesized as an important sink of plastic debris.},

However, status competition is also associated with excessive expenditure on status goods, greater likelihood of bankruptcy, and more risk taking by money managers. This paper examines the effects of recognition and status competition jointly. In particular, we focus on the spillover effects of public recognition on the performance and risk taking of peers. Using newly collected data on monthly “victory” scores of more than 5,000 German pilots during World War II, we find that status competition had important effects: After the German armed forces bulletin mentioned the accomplishments of a particular fighter pilot, his former peers performed considerably better. This outperformance varied across skill groups. When a former squadron peer was mentioned, the best pilots tried harder, scored more, and died no more frequently; in contrast, average pilots won only a few additional victories but died at a significantly higher rate. Hence our results show that the overall efficiency effect of nonfinancial rewards can be ambiguous in settings where both risk and output affect aggregate performance.},

  comment={Some research by Yascha Mounk contradicts the idea which ``Political scientists have a theory called “democratic consolidation,” which holds that once countries develop democratic institutions, a robust civil society and a certain level of wealth, their democracy is secure.  For decades, global events seemed to support that idea. Data from Freedom House, a watchdog organization that measures democracy and freedom around the world, shows that the number of countries classified as “free” rose steadily from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s. Many Latin American countries transitioned from military rule to democracy; after the end of the Cold War, much of Eastern Europe followed suit. And longstanding liberal democracies in North America, Western Europe and Australia seemed more secure than ever.'' This research created an index of democratic stability and their index suggest that Western democracies are weakening. The research suffers from a correlation vs causation problem, and it is only one measure. But the reasearcher adds: ``the minutiae of politics can easily distract from these more fundamental dangers. “It’s not just about what Trump will do to the E.P.A.,” he said, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency. “It really is that Trump may try to undermine liberal democracy in the United States.”''},

% I find this argument wholly unconvincing. There are real criticisms to be made with identity politics, (some alluded to here) but costing the Democrats the election is not one of them.
% Americans might often been annoyed or feel slightly alienated by identity politics, but most people don't actually despise them. That's why they poke fun at it rather than protest it.
% The Democrats lost because they ran a candidate who completely failed to present any kind of vision against establishment politics. Presenting as anti-establishment is what won every election since 2000. It's why Bush won, it's why Obama won, and it's why Trump won. (Or maybe more importantly NOT presenting as anti-establishment is why Gore, Kerry, Romney, and Clinton LOST.)

  abstract={This paper reports the results of a national survey in which perceptions of environmental health risks were measured for 1275 white and 214 nonwhite persons. The results showed that white women perceived risks to be much higher than did white men, a result that is consistent with previous studies. However, this gender difference was not true of nonwhite women and men, whose perceptions of risk were quite similar. Most striking was the finding that white males tended to differ from everyone else in their attitudes and perceptions–on average, they perceived risks as much smaller and much more acceptable than did other people. These results suggest that sociopolitical factors such as power, status, alienation, and trust are strong determiners of people's perception and acceptance of risks.},

Thus they call for the phenomenon to be named the same thing it is in science: ``short-range apparent motion.''},

  comment = {Klosterman makes a game of thinking about who future historians will remember as the embodiment of rock and roll.

If Sousa represents all marching music, who is going to represent all rock and roll? },

% Klosterman quote jazz historian Ted Gioia who believes that specialists are the people who galvanize history. Critics have almost no impact on what music is popular at any given time, but they’re extraordinarily well positioned to dictate what music is reintroduced after its popularity has waned: ``critics and music historians hate sentimental love songs. They’ve constructed a perspective that emphasizes the rise of rock and pushes everything else into the background. Transgressive rockers, in contrast, enjoy lasting fame.'' 
% ``He points to a contemporary version of that phenomenon: “Right now, electronic dance music probably outsells hip‑hop. This is identical to the punk‑versus‑disco trade‑off of the 1970s. My prediction: edgy hip‑hop music will win the fame game in the long run, while E.D.M. will be seen as another mindless dance craze.”'' 
% ``His example is the adversarial divide between punk and disco: In 1977, the disco soundtrack to “Saturday Night Fever” and the Sex Pistols’ “Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols” were both released. The soundtrack to “Saturday Night Fever” has sold more than 15 million copies; it took “Never Mind the Bollocks” 15 years to go platinum. Yet virtually all pop historiographers elevate the importance of the Pistols above that of the Bee Gees. The same year the Sex Pistols finally sold the millionth copy of their debut, SPIN magazine placed them on a list of the seven greatest bands of all time. “Never Mind the Bollocks” is part of the White House record library, supposedly inserted by Amy Carter just before her dad lost to Ronald Reagan. The album’s reputation improves by simply existing: In 1985, the British publication NME classified it as the 13th‑greatest album of all time; in 1993, NME made a new list and decided it now deserved to be ranked third. This has as much to do with its transgressive identity as its musical integrity. The album is overtly transgressive (and therefore memorable), while “Saturday Night Fever” has been framed as a prefab totem of a facile culture (and thus forgettable). For more than three decades, that has been the overwhelming consensus.'' 
% ``But I’ve noticed — just in the last four or five years — that this consensus is shifting. Why? Because the definition of “transgressive” is shifting. It’s no longer appropriate to dismiss disco as superficial. More and more, we recognize how disco latently pushed gay, urban culture into white suburbia, which is a more meaningful transgression than going on a British TV talk show and swearing at the host.'' 
% Klosterman points out that Johnny B. Goode is on the song on Voyager though. (Against Alan Lomax's wishes.) Here Comes the Sun was floated, all four Beatles wanted it, but none of them owned the copyright so it was killed for legal reasons.

  abstract = { Racial capitalism — the process of deriving social and economic value from racial identity — is a longstanding, common, and deeply problematic practice. This Article is the first to identify racial capitalism as a systemic phenomenon and to undertake a close examination of its causes and consequences.  The Article focuses on instances of racial capitalism in which white individuals and predominantly white institutions use nonwhite people to acquire social and economic value. Affirmative action doctrine and policies provide much of the impetus for this form of racial capitalism. These doctrines and policies have fueled an intense legal and social preoccupation with the notion of diversity, which encourages white individuals and predominantly white institutions to engage in racial capitalism by deriving value from nonwhite racial identity. An examination of the consequences of racial capitalism is particularly timely given the Supreme Court’s pending decision in Fisher v. University of Texas, a challenge to the affirmative action policy at the University of Texas.  Racial capitalism has serious negative consequences both for individuals and for society as a whole. The process of racial capitalism relies upon and reinforces commodification of racial identity, which degrades that identity by reducing it to another thing to be bought and sold. Commodification can also foster racial resentment by causing nonwhite people to feel used or exploited by white people. And the superficial value assigned to nonwhiteness within a system of racial capitalism displaces measures that would lead to meaningful social reform.  In an ideal society, racial capitalism would not occur. Given the imperfections of our current society, however, this Article instead proposes a pragmatic approach to dismantling racial capitalism, one that recognizes that progress must occur incrementally. Under such an approach, we would discourage racial capitalism. But if racial capitalism did occur, we would identify it explicitly, call attention to its harms, and impose penalties on those who engage in racial capitalism. Moreover, we should ensure that any transaction involving racial value is structured so as to discourage future racial capitalism. I briefly survey some of the various legal mechanisms that can be deployed to discourage racial capitalism through limited commodification. Ultimately, this approach will allow progress toward a society in which we successfully recognize and respect racial identity without engaging in racial capitalism.},

In such situations individuals can exhibit both primacy bias towards the first option and recency bias towards the last option.  We examine this phenomenon in a particularly interesting context: consumer response to the ordering of economics papers in an email announcement issued by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).  Each Monday morning Eastern Standard Time (EST) the NBER issues a “New This Week” (NTW) email that lists all of the working papers that have been issued in the past week.  This email goes to more than 23,000 subscribers, both inside and outside academia, and the placement order is based on random factors.  We show that despite the randomized list placement, papers that are listed first each week are about 30% more likely to be viewed, downloaded, and cited over the next two years.  Lower ranking on the list leads to fewer views and downloads, but not cites; however, there is also some recency bias, with the last paper listed receiving more views, downloads and cites.  The results are robust to a wide variety of specification checks and are present for both all viewers/downloaders, and for academic institutions in particular.   These results suggest that even among expert searchers, list-based searches can be manipulated by list placement.},

But the most interesting thing is the DIFFERENCE between the Nazis and the US now: it is no longer necessary to eliminate opposition parties.

In particular, we use legal actions brought against publicly traded firms over the 20 year sample period that progress to trial from 1995-2014.  In terms of magnitude, the increase is sizable: targeted local advertising increases by 23% (t=4.39) following the suit.  Moreover, firms concentrate these strategic increases in locations where the return on their advertising dollars are largest: in smaller, more concentrated advertising markets where fewer competitor firms are advertising.  They focus their advertisement spikes specifically toward jury trials, and in fact specifically toward the most likely jury pool.  Lastly, we document that these advertising spikes are associated with verdicts, increasing the probability of a favorable outcome.},

We make an explicit distinction between ideas and vested interests and show how they feed into each other. In doing so the paper integrates the Keynes-Hayek perspective on the importance of ideas with the currently more fashionable Stigler-Becker (interests only) approach to political economy. We distinguish between two kinds of ideational politics – the battle among different worldviews on the efficacy of policy (worldview politics) versus the politics of victimhood, pride and identity (identity politics). Political entrepreneurs discover identity and policy ‘memes’ (narratives, cues, framing) that shift beliefs about how the world works or a person’s belief of who he is (i.e. identity). Our framework identifies a complementarity between worldview politics and identity politics and illustrates how they may reinforce each other. In particular, an increase in identity polarization may be associated with a shift in views about how the world works. Furthermore, an increase in income inequality is likely to result in a greater incidence of ideational politics. Finally, we show how ideas may not just constrain, but also ‘bite’ the interests that helped propagate them in the first instance.},

  month={04},
  year={2018},
  comment={Kinda meanders around for a while, but eventually gets down to some really interesting points about how the Democratic party is making a huge mistake by avoid self-criticism on what went wrong in 2016. It has some interesting corollary to Edsall's 3-29 piece in the Times. ``It has led the Democrats into a trap familiar to anyone with experience of left-wing politics: the party’s own high regard for itself has come to eclipse every other concern. Among the authorized opinion leaders of liberalism, for example, the task of deploring and denouncing the would-be dictator has crowded out the equally important task of assessing where the Democratic Party went wrong. Indeed, the two projects appear to them to be contradictory --- they find it impossible to flagellate Trump one day and examine themselves the next. Of the two, it is introspection that must hit the bricks. And it is uncompromising moral stridor that has come to dominate the opinion pages and the airwaves of the enlightened --- a continuous outpouring of agony and aghastitude at Trump and his works.  This is unfortunate, because what happened in 2016 deserves to be taken seriously. This country of 320 million people was swept by a tidal wave of populist rage. Alongside the ugly eruption of bigotry there swirled perfectly natural concerns about deindustrialization, oligarchy, the power of big banks, bad trade deals, and the long-term abandonment of working-class concerns by the Democrats.'' ``But most leading Democrats can’t seem to see any of that. They don’t know what to make of Trump and his supporters, so violently does Trumpism transgress the professional norms to which they are accustomed. It is distasteful to them that they should be required to learn anything from a clown like the current president --- that they should have to change in any way to accommodate his preposterous views. And so they cast about for leaders who might allow them to prevail without doing anything differently: a celebrity who might communicate better, a politician who might turn out the base more effectively. They devour articles about Trump voters who have had a change of heart and now beg forgiveness for their sins. They chide other liberals whom they regard as insufficiently enthusiastic about the Democratic Party. Above all, they dream of a deus ex machina, a super-prosecutor who will bring down justice like fire and reverse the unfortunate results of 2016 without anyone having to change their talking points in the slightest.'' ``On the other hand, in the vast catalogue of social posturing, there are few more repugnant sights than rich people congratulating themselves for being righteous. In particular, it is a terrible way to win back the blue-collar white voters who were responsible, even more than were the Russians, for Trump’s win.'' ``For them, there’s an alternative to political victory: a utopia of scolding. Who needs to win elections when you can personally reestablish the rightful social order every day on Twitter and Facebook? When you can scold, and scold, and scold, and scold. That’s their future, and it’s a satisfying one: a finger wagging in some deplorable’s face, forever.''},

  comment={An amazing narrative article about some of the reporters on the recieving end of the information Snowden released. Covers basic issues of information security as well. ``The more details that emerged about the reach and sophistication of government surveillance, the more absurd our situation seemed. Some of the most sensitive intelligence information in the world had traveled in plain sight through the U.S. mail, then sat in my hallway, where it could have been pilfered as casually as all those other packages. Thinking about that made my head spin. It also reflected what I consider to be one of the great lessons of adulthood: that most of the institutions and endeavors we regard as ironclad — from parenting to politics — are actually held together with chewing gum and duct tape. Nothing truly works, at least not for long, or not in the way it’s supposed to. This reality is terrifying, because it exposes the precariousness of the existing order. But it’s also liberating, because it encourages the individual to act, to defy the ominous mythology of competence and control.'' ``In a video posted by the Guardian on June 9, 2013, Snowden seemed strangely prescient about what was to come. “There will be a time,” he said, “when policies will change”: The only thing that restricts the activities of the surveillance state are policy. Even our agreements with other sovereign governments. We consider that to be a stipulation of policy rather than a stipulation of law. And because of that, a new leader will be elected. They’ll flip the switch, say that because of the crisis, because of the dangers that we face in the world, you know, some new and unpredicted threat, we need more authority. We need more power. And there will be nothing the people can do at that point to oppose it, and it will be turnkey tyranny.''},

  Title={I Thought I Understood the American Right.  Trump Proved Me Wrong.},
  journal={The New York Times},
  date={2017-04-11},
  comment={Through a detailed look at the history of the American right, a historian of conservatism looks back at how he and his peers failed to anticipate the rise of the president because historians undervalued the power of the fringe movements of conservatism. Conservatism was thought to be vanquished by the New Deal at the end of World War II, until William F. Buckley Jr. restarted the movement with the National Review. National Review wanted to express an intelligent conservative viewpoint, a coherent view that eventually became the dominant form of conservatism. Part of this was conservatives denouncing the paranoid fringe. But Trump forced a change to that narrative - he embraced the paranoid fringe. Historians never saw this coming. Richard Hofstadter pushed the idea that there was a "consensus" school of historians; that Americans agreed upon moderate liberalism as the nation's natural governing philosophy. This idea discounted the conservatives of the 1960s as far-right kooks (like Barry Goldwater and Joseph McCarthy). He called them "the paranoid style in American politics". But Reagan's success undermines Hofstadter's notion that conservatism was over. Lisa McGirr wrote a book in 2001 called “Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right” which became a cornerstone of the movement among historians to deal with the right as smart people reacting against liberal permissiveness. But Perlstein argues these historian gave too MUCH credit to the conservatism being a sensible movement and not enough to the crazy fringe. Hofstadter was overly dismissive, and McGirr (and Perlstein) gave conservatives too much credit. Leo Ribuffo comes along and argues that America’s anti-liberal traditions were far more deeply rooted in the past, and far angrier, than most historians would acknowledge. Among the fringe conservative history now recognized as relevant (in the wake of Trump) is the Klan's notion that social democracy should be reserved only for white people and supported public education - to weaken catholic schools. The Klan had a group called the Black Legion with 135,000 people in it in 1936. Humphrey Bogart starred in a movie about it. But most historian had never heard of it. This article also covers Father Charles Coughlin, a radio priest out of Detroit with 30 million listeners who started a magazine called Social Justice. But he started preaching anti-Semitism like Henry Ford and led to support of a pro Hitler rally in 1939 Madison Square Garden where the leader spoke in front of an enormous picture of George Washington flanked by swastikas.},

In the final years of his life he rejected the optimism of the "I Have a Dream" speech and instead mourned how it had "turned into a nightmare." He highlighted how civil rights was never a discrete problem in American society, and that racism went hand in hand with the fellow evils of poverty and militarism. He was against the war early, but decided not to denounce the war right away because “Sometimes the public is not ready to digest the truth.” ``Dr. King remained relatively mute about the war through most of 1966, but by year’s end he was expressing private disgust at how increased military spending had torn a gaping budget hole in Johnson’s Great Society domestic programs.'' He got a standing ovation in the church, but the press came out against him. ``The New York Times called Dr. King’s remarks both “facile” and “slander.” It said the moral issues in Vietnam “are less clear-cut than he suggests” and warned that “to divert the energies of the civil rights movement to the Vietnam issue is both wasteful and self-defeating,” given how the movement needed to confront what the paper called “the intractability of slum mores and habits.”'' ``Dr. King was indeed ahead of his time, but not for long. A year later, antiwar sentiment pushed Johnson out of his re-election bid, and today we remember opposition to the war as a widespread phenomenon, so much so that Dr. King’s Riverside Church speech is often overlooked as just one more statement against an unpopular conflict.''},

% It's a little annoying that he asides Curtis as "over-the-top" when discussing _Trump_. Especially since Curtis' "over-the-top"ness was far more accurate about the outcome of the election than anyone's even-handed analysis.
% Also, for some reason it seems like the only thing people take away from Hypernormalisation is Surkov? I didn't think that was the most convincing part of the film, precisely because I think Trump IS psychotic, not calculating and strategic. It's just that his psychosis happens to FUNCTION in a way that is beneficial to him - through sheer happenstance.

  journal={The New Yorker},
  date={2017-02-27},
  comment={Discusses different implications of human inability to reason. ``Humans’ biggest advantage over other species is our ability to coöperate. Coöperation is difficult to establish and almost as difficult to sustain. For any individual, freeloading is always the best course of action. Reason developed not to enable us to solve abstract, logical problems or even to help us draw conclusions from unfamiliar data; rather, it developed to resolve the problems posed by living in collaborative groups.'' ``the task that reason evolved to perform, which is to prevent us from getting screwed by the other members of our group. Living in small bands of hunter-gatherers, our ancestors were primarily concerned with their social standing, and with making sure that they weren’t the ones risking their lives on the hunt while others loafed around in the cave. There was little advantage in reasoning clearly, while much was to be gained from winning arguments.'' Also covers the illusion of explanatory depth: ``People believe that they know way more than they actually do. What allows us to persist in this belief is other people. In the case of my toilet, someone else designed it so that I can operate it easily. This is something humans are very good at. We’ve been relying on one another’s expertise ever since we figured out how to hunt together, which was probably a key development in our evolutionary history. So well do we collaborate, Sloman and Fernbach argue, that we can hardly tell where our own understanding ends and others’ begins.'' ``Where it gets us into trouble, according to Sloman and Fernbach, is in the political domain...“As a rule, strong feelings about issues do not emerge from deep understanding,” Sloman and Fernbach write. And here our dependence on other minds reinforces the problem. If your position on, say, the Affordable Care Act is baseless and I rely on it, then my opinion is also baseless. When I talk to Tom and he decides he agrees with me, his opinion is also baseless, but now that the three of us concur we feel that much more smug about our views. If we all now dismiss as unconvincing any information that contradicts our opinion, you get, well, the Trump Administration.'' ``If we—or our friends or the pundits on CNN—spent less time pontificating and more trying to work through the implications of policy proposals, we’d realize how clueless we are and moderate our views. This, they write, “may be the only form of thinking that will shatter the illusion of explanatory depth and change people’s attitudes.”'' ``Providing people with accurate information doesn’t seem to help; they simply discount it. Appealing to their emotions may work better, but doing so is obviously antithetical to the goal of promoting sound science. “The challenge that remains,” they write toward the end of their book, “is to figure out how to address the tendencies that lead to false scientific belief.”''},

  journal={Curbed},
  date={2017-01-17},
  comment={Discusses the fact that the US is polarized based on type of place: urban vs rural, and the differences aren't about a single issue, but pretty much everything. Raises the question: if richer more centrist liberals are moving into cities, will the cities become more centrist in politics than their traditional left-wing working class? ``There’s a shift that’s been happening over the past 10 or 15 years, where the more conservative upper middle class is moving from the suburbs into urban areas, which have for a long time been bastions of a more liberal working class. How is that changing cities?  Lily Geismer: A lot of it has to do with how you define liberal and conservative. Oftentimes there's this affluent group of people who have come in, who are quite liberal on social issues, and are liberal about issues on the national level. But what I tracked in my research is the closer you got to people’s property values, their tax rates, and their children’s educations, they became less collective-minded or less progressive, which is sort of more conservative in their values.'' Also a nice thought about public-private partnerships: ``There always was a place for the private sector and this idea of public-private partnerships. That was at the heart of things like urban renewal in the 1950s and 1960s. But there’s a difference—the New Deal was about stimulating those sectors and working in partnership, and this is letting the private sector do a lot, if not most, of the work. And that shift occurred in the 1970s, in response to a recession and the rise of inflation. There was pushback against Keynesian economic models that led to this notion that the private sector is a more effective way of getting things done. There’s also a lot of pushback against large government bureaucracy that emerges during that time, this idea that it’s better and more efficient if it comes from the private sector.''},
  category={Politics, polarization, urban vesus rural, yuppies, public-private partnerships, keynesian economics, Economics}
}
% One of the huge unspoken problems is that neither the left or the right actually wants to do ALL the things necessary to achieve the outcomes that come from their values.
% For instance, if the liberals actually want to increase social safety net programs, they HAVE to address the more than a billions dollars a day we spend on defense.
Why do we spend so much on defence? Because we have a military presense across the world.
% If we reduce that military presense significantly, we reduce our global influence significantly. If we reduce our global influence, we reduce the resources we have for social safety nets.
% Or conservatives might want to cut down the government, and keep the military at home. But that would mean cutting back our miltary, and our global influence too.
% Without that global influence, we won't be able to keep global corporations, a group conservatives are very committed to.
% The truth is, if we want to become an isolationist, independent country, if we want to not be responsible for the rest of the world, if we want to take care of our own, the whole system has to change. Burn the whole thing down.
% And it will come with an economic haircut for the middle class and the wealthy, (assuming your are willing to build the social safety net for the poor.)
% There is no way to keep what we have now and at the same time change things for the values of the right or the left.
% It's like a political version of intersectionality - there's no way to move forward without considering all the different influences. Interestingly, there's no way to move forward without causing pain to some of those influences. (That might be true of intersectionality in general.)
% Sadly no liberal with that agenda has ever made it into power. Even more sadly, an insane right-wing demagogue HAS made it into just such a position of power.
% There is of course the middle-ground policy-tweaking of the Obama administration - where people in power try to keep everyone happy while squeezing out some small benefits for the poor.
% This, by definition, requires not cutting benefits to most people.
% This also, clearly, does not work. There is no way for the US to reduce its insane carbon output without cutting back on consumer goods, global trade, and global influence. That won't happen without cutting down our global military presense. If it does happen, the middle class (and the rich) will be generally far worse off than it is now.

These deliver worse material outcomes in general, but they reduce the feelings of betrayal during bad times. We find some evidence consistent with our model in a survey carried out on the eve of the recent U.S. presidential election.  Priming survey participants with questions about the importance of competence in policymaking usually reduced their support for the candidate who was perceived as less competent; this effect was reversed for rural, and less educated white, survey participants.},

  journal={The New York Times},
  date={2016-12-23},
  comment={Looking at the data on the election shows that Clinton did not lose because of a turnout problem, but because lower-income working-class white voters of the North who voted for Obama in the last election, voted for Trump in this one. The Clinton administration knew this was a problem. ``Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump ran against the establishment — and against a candidate who embodied it far more than John McCain or Mr. Romney did. The various allegations against Mrs. Clinton neatly complemented the notion that she wasn’t out to help ordinary Americans.'' There was also a large decline in black voter turnout - likely because there was just less interest in voting for a white person at the top of the ticket. Note that decline was similar across the country, regarldess of new laws that might reduce turnout. If black turnout had matches 2012 levels Clinton probably would have won. However, Obama could have won even with low black turnout. Also: ``Mrs. Clinton’s gains were concentrated among the most affluent and best-educated white voters, much as Mr. Trump’s gains were concentrated among the lowest-income and least-educated white voters.''},

  comment={Researches from Harvard who claim that Trump tests positive as an anti-democratic politician. Points out that democracy depends on politicians adhereing to a bunch of unstated traditions and guidelines: ``Democratic institutions must be reinforced by strong informal norms. Like a pickup basketball game without a referee, democracies work best when unwritten rules of the game, known and respected by all players, ensure a minimum of civility and cooperation. Norms serve as the soft guardrails of democracy, preventing political competition from spiraling into a chaotic, no-holds-barred conflict. Among the unwritten rules that have sustained American democracy are partisan self-restraint and fair play. For much of our history, leaders of both parties resisted the temptation to use their temporary control of institutions to maximum partisan advantage, effectively underutilizing the power conferred by those institutions. There existed a shared understanding, for example, that anti-majoritarian practices like the Senate filibuster would be used sparingly, that the Senate would defer (within reason) to the president in nominating Supreme Court justices, and that votes of extraordinary importance — like impeachment — required a bipartisan consensus. Such practices helped to avoid a descent into the kind of partisan fight to the death that destroyed many European democracies in the 1930s.''},

  journal={The New Yorker},
  date={2016-11-07},
  comment={Review of books arguing against systems of popular democracy and for some kind of modified representative system.  Describes David Estlund's defense of democracy, which ends up resting on the argument ``that universal suffrage is so established in our minds as a default that giving the knowledgeable power over the ignorant will always feel more unjust than giving those in the majority power over those in the minority.'' Describes Jason Brennan's argument that ``American voters have remained ignorant despite decades of rising education levels. Some economists have argued that ill-informed voters, far from being lazy or self-sabotaging, should be seen as rational actors. If the odds that your vote will be decisive are minuscule---Brennan writes that `you are more likely to win Powerball a few times in a row'---then learning about politics isn’t worth even a few minutes of your time.'' And, ``He was equally unimpressed by the argument that it’s one’s duty to vote. `It would be bad if no one farmed,' he wrote, `but that does not imply that everyone should farm.' In fact, he suspected, the imperative to vote might be even weaker than the imperative to farm. After all, by not voting you do your neighbor a good turn. `If I do not vote, your vote counts more,' Brennan wrote.'' Brennan splits voters into groups: ``Brennan calls people who don’t bother to learn about politics hobbits, and he thinks it for the best if they stay home on Election Day. A second group of people enjoy political news as a recreation, following it with the partisan devotion of sports fans, and Brennan calls them hooligans. Third in his bestiary are vulcans, who investigate politics with scientific objectivity, respect opposing points of view, and carefully adjust their opinions to the facts, which they seek out diligently. It’s vulcans, presumably, who Brennan hopes will someday rule over us, but he doesn’t present compelling evidence that they really exist. In fact, one study he cites shows that even people with excellent math skills tend not to draw on them if doing so risks undermining a cherished political belief. This shouldn’t come as a surprise. In recent memory, sophisticated experts have been confident about many proposals that turned out to be disastrous---invading Iraq, having a single European currency, grinding subprime mortgages into the sausage known as collateralized debt obligations, and so on.'' But Brennan doesn't really offer any kind of viable alternative or method for selecting vulcans. Some other references are referred to as well: ``In `The Myth of the Rational Voter' (2007), the economist Bryan Caplan suggested that ignorance may even be gratifying to voters. `Some beliefs are more emotionally appealing,' Caplan observed, so if your vote isn’t likely to do anything why not indulge yourself in what you want to believe, whether or not it’s true? Caplan argues that it’s only because of the worthlessness of an individual vote that so many voters look beyond their narrow self-interest: in the polling booth, the warm, fuzzy feeling of altruism can be had cheap.'' The author wraps up by comparing voting to combat: ``But maybe voting is neither commons nor market. Perhaps, instead, it’s combat. Relatively gentle, of course.  Rather than rifles and bayonets, essentially there’s just a show of hands. But the nature of the duty may be similar, because what Brennan’s model omits is that sometimes, in an election, democracy itself is in danger. If a soldier were to calculate his personal value to the campaign that his army is engaged in, he could easily conclude that the cost of showing up at the front isn’t worth it, even if he factors in the chance of being caught and punished for desertion. The trouble is that it’s impossible to know in advance of a battle which side will prevail, let alone by how great a margin, especially if morale itself is a variable. The lack of certainty about the future makes a hash of merely prudential calculation. It’s said that most soldiers worry more about letting down the fellow-soldiers in their unit than about allegiance to an entity as abstract as the nation, and maybe voters, too, feel their duty most acutely toward friends and family who share their idea of where the country needs to go.''},

If we work to strengthen unions, that will trickle down to you. If we work to strengthen health care, that will trickle down to you. If we work to make all schools better, that will trickle down to you. After decades of Democratic loyalty, too many black Americans are still awaiting that trickle.''},

Or it could be that the sample is too small (one presidential election every 4 years, and one soccer championship a year do not yield very big samples). Or it could be that the rules in these games are always changing. ``In a game, the rules are fixed. If you spin a roulette wheel, or even send a baseball team out on the field to face an opponent, there are a set range of things that can happen, and it’s relatively straightforward to figure out the probability of each.  But in politics, external events, media coverage, public opinion and the strategies of opponents — even the number of opponents — are constantly in flux in unpredictable ways.

Despite millenniums of cultivated cultural and linguistic provinces, China is transcending its traditional internal boundaries to become an empire of 26 megacity clusters with populations of up to 100 million each, centered around hubs such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing-Chengdu.'' ``What would this approach look like in America?

Judges selected by non-partisan elections write higher-quality opinions than judges selected by partisan elections. Judges selected by technocratic merit commissions write higher-quality opinions than either partisan-elected judges or non-partisan-elected judges. Election-year politics reduces judicial performance in both partisan and non-partisan election systems. Giving stronger tenure to non-partisan-selected judges improves performance, while giving stronger tenure to partisan-selected judges has no effect.

Also consistent with the predictions of our model, the drop-off in ratings for private channels with moderate ideology takes an intermediate value. In addition, the drop-off is stronger for viewers with access to cable channels, which are not required to air cadenas. Consistent with this result, we also show that viewership of an opposition cable channel rises during cadenas. Complementing this analysis, we then estimate the parameters of the theoretical model in a structural analysis. Using these parameter estimates, we consider counterfactual scenarios, allowing for an examination of the dynamic responses of viewers of differing ideology to cadenas and an analysis of the welfare consequences of cadenas.},

One reason is that the unseen catastrophe was a mainstay of the early-sixties exposé. A month before “The Battered-Child Syndrome” appeared, The New Yorker serialized Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring.” Seven months later, the magazine published “Our Invisible Poor,” by Dwight Macdonald. Carson ushered in the modern environmental movement; Macdonald is credited with helping to launch the War on Poverty. And Kempe launched the campaign against child abuse.'' ``Still, that doesn’t quite explain the relative lack of interest in child abuse in the twenties, thirties, forties, or fifties. This is nicely addressed by Macdonald. “There is a monotony about the injustices suffered by the poor that perhaps accounts for the lack of interest the rest of society shows in them,” he wrote. “Everything seems to go wrong with them.

Support for conservative interests rises and Republican political candidates gain votes after booms, leading to a near doubling in the probability of a change in incumbency.  All of this change occurs at the expense of Democrats.  Voting records of U.S. House members from boom districts become sharply more conservative across a wide range of issues, including issues unrelated to energy policy.  At the level of the individual, marginal candidates skew their voting behavior somewhat toward more conservative causes, but generally not enough to maintain power.  Thus, even when the stakes are high and politicians risk losing power, ideology trumps ambition.},

% (If the atomic bomb represents the pinnacle of the failure of modernism, what does it say that the AK-47 was so successful?) For me, this book makes the argument that the assault rifle (\emph{true} assault rifles - which are banned in the US - not the oversized semi-automatic handguns which the US keeps trying to ban) are the fundamental tool of modern war. Without them, you cannot carry out a war/defense. With them, a small underfunded country like Iraq can hold the largest most modern army in the world at bay nearly indefinitely.

  Title={How the Gun Control Debate Ignores Black Lives},
  journal={ProPublica},
  date={2015-11-24},
  comment = {An in-depth article about the reality of gun-violence and politics in America. ``In 2009, the gun homicide rate for white Americans was 2 per 100,000 — about seven times as high as the rate for residents of Denmark, but a fraction of the rate for black Americans. In 2009, black Americans faced a gun homicide rate of nearly 15 per 100,000. That’s higher than the gun homicide rate in Mexico.'' ``Even in high-crime cities, the risk of gun violence is mostly concentrated among a small number of men. In Oakland, for instance, crime experts working with the police department a few years ago found that about 1,000 active members of a few dozen street groups drove most homicides. That’s .3 percent of Oakland’s population. And even within this subgroup, risk fluctuated according to feuds and other beefs. In practical terms, the experts found that over a given stretch of several months only about 50 to 100 men are at the highest risk of shooting someone or getting shot.'' Includes an account of how Boston dramatically lowered gun deaths by working with the community of men most at risk to change the dynamics and offer them protection if someone is shot, called Operation Ceasefire, or more technically ``focussed deterrence''. ``Part of what seems to make Ceasefire effective is that it treats the men it targets as both dangerous and also in need of help. Such initiatives, however, fit into no political camp and thus have few powerful champions.  “It has no natural constituency,” said Thomas Abt, a Harvard Kennedy School researcher who has worked on crime policy at the Justice Department. “To vastly oversimplify, progressives want more prevention and conservatives want more enforcement. Focused deterrence” — what academics call Ceasefire and similar approaches — “challenges the orthodoxy on both sides. It makes everybody uncomfortable.”'' ``Most researchers agree that a better background check system could help curtail both urban gun violence and mass shootings, though there’s no hard data to indicate how much.'' ``Children are in far more danger outside of schools than in schools. If we had to take officers out of the community to put them in schools, then actually children will be less safe rather than more safe.''},

  abstract={This paper examines the science-of-science-communication measurement problem. In its simplest form, the problem reflects the use of externally invalid measures of the dynamics that generate cultural conflict over risk and other policy-relevant facts. But at a more fundamental level, the science-of-science-communication measurement problem inheres in the phenomena being measured themselves. The “beliefs” individuals form about a societal risk such as climate change are not of a piece; rather they reflect the distinct clusters of inferences that individuals draw as they engage information for two distinct ends: to gain access to the collective knowledge furnished by science, and to enjoy the sense of identity enabled by membership in a community defined by particular cultural commitments. The paper shows how appropriately designed “science comprehension” tests — one general, and one specific to climate change — can be used to measure individuals’ reasoning proficiency as collective-knowledge acquirers independently of their reasoning proficiency as cultural-identity protectors. Doing so reveals that there is in fact little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens on what science knows about climate change. The source of the climate-change controversy and like disputes is the contamination of education and politics with forms of cultural status competition that make it impossible for diverse citizens to express their reason as both collective-knowledge acquirers and cultural-identity protectors at the same time.},

While many indicators of survey quality have steadily declined in recent decades, the literature has largely emphasized rising nonresponse rates rather than other potentially more important dimensions to the problem. We divide the problem into rising rates of nonresponse, imputation, and measurement error, documenting the rise in each of these threats to survey quality over the past three decades.  A fundamental problem in assessing biases due to these problems in surveys is the lack of a benchmark or measure of truth, leading us to focus on the accuracy of the reporting of government transfers. We provide evidence from aggregate measures of transfer reporting as well as linked microdata. We discuss the relative importance of misreporting of program receipt and conditional amounts of benefits received, as well as some of the conjectured reasons for declining cooperation and survey errors. We end by discussing ways to reduce the impact of the problem including the increased use of administrative data and the possibilities for combining administrative and survey data.},

On non-lethal uses of force, blacks and Hispanics are more than fifty percent more likely to experience some form of force in interactions with police. Adding controls that account for important context and civilian behavior reduces, but cannot fully explain, these disparities. On the most extreme use of force – officer-involved shootings – we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account. We argue that the patterns in the data are consistent with a model in which police officers are utility maximizers, a fraction of which have a preference for discrimination, who incur relatively high expected costs of officer-involved shootings.},

Black and white civilians involved in police shootings were equally likely to have been carrying a weapon.'' And, in Houston, in tense shoot-or-don't-shoot situations, Fryer found that cops were about 20\% less likely to shoot if the suspect was black. However, lethal use of force is very rare. Fryer also found that excessive use of every day force, like drawing a weapon, shoving someone against a wall, or putting hands on someone is far more common for black people than white people. ``“Who the hell wants to have a police officer put their hand on them or yell and scream at them? It’s an awful experience,” he said. “I’ve had it multiple, multiple times. Every black man I know has had this experience. Every one of them. It is hard to believe that the world is your oyster if the police can rough you up without punishment. And when I talked to minority youth, almost every single one of them mentions lower level uses of force as the reason why they believe the world is corrupt.”''},

Martinson himself thought that saying nothing works would lead to \emph{closing} of most prisons. Martinson eventually comes full circle and retracts all of his earlier findings before the '80s even start. He ends up committing suicide.

Includes Stamets heuristic for identifying them: If a gilled mushroom has purplish brown to black spores, and the flesh bruises bluish, the mushroom in question is very likely a psilocybin-producing species. Tells how to do a spore print: lay the cap on a white piece of paper (if the spores are dark-colored) and let sit for a few hours under a glass (to preserve moisture). Works best with fresh mushrooms. Also covers some of the history of psychedelic mushrooms - mostly in mesoamerica and how that history was repressed by white invaders. Describes the habitat of the mushrooms: they grow on dead plant matter and like disturbed habitats like landslides or eroded places - this means they have benefited greatly from human civilization because humans bring habitat disruption with them everywhere, particularly with civilization. Stamets attributes this to a kind of intelligence on the part of the mushrooms. The forword by Andrew Weil includes a paragraph about the uncanniness of how these mushrooms evolved this chemical that affects humans so profoundly, and how this suggests a much deeper complexity to the universe than is commonly understood (read: magic).},

% My under-informed crackpot theory is that ancient humans are _responsible_ for the evolution of these mushrooms.
% Some early gatherers notice a mild chemical pleasure from certain mushrooms, so they start cultivating those by eating more of them.
% Those mushroom evolve more of the chemicals in response. They learn to grow in the human's environments and spread with humans around the world.
% This is mostly supported by the fact that there's a lot of mushrooms growing in regions populated early by humans (if you look at a map) like Africa, and across Russia.
% In North America the mushrooms grow right down the path of human incursion from Russia. There's far more in the Pacific Northwest than in the Northeast.

  comment={Review of The Incest Diary by Anonymous. A memoir about a woman repeatedly raped by her father as she was growing up. The unique thing is the author admits, in some case, to enjoying sex with her father. ``As much as The Incest Diary is a book about pain, it is undeniably also a book about pleasure. The author lusted and lusts still after her father. She is furious when she comes to realize that he also has sex with her mother. When she is eight years old and they move to a new house, she assumes that she will share the master bedroom with him. After her parents divorce two years later, she begins leading her father into his room for sex. Even once the abuse is over, she cannot have an orgasm without seeing her father’s face, “as if my ultimate erotic experience is being raped by the man who created me.” A few times a year, she has a dream in which it is just her and her father, alone in the world, fucking “all we want.” “My father is my secret,” she writes. “But the secret under the secret is that sometimes I liked it. Sometimes I wanted it, and sometimes I seduced him and made him fuck me.'' The reviewer points out that this suggests that consent (or lack of it) is not enough to recognize victims of sexual violence. ``'This is why the question of whether or not a child “wants it” is irrelevant to the morality of pedophilia: not because children don’t want it — or do want it — but because “wanting it” is itself something so easily formed by adult violence. And not just the declaration of the wanting — what is a child’s “let’s fuck” but a simulacrum of consent? — but the wanting itself. When a victim of sexual abuse says she wanted it, she is telling us about the sort of person the abuse required her to be. '},

  comment={``The benefits of nonsexual touch read like a 19th-century tonic advertisement, except that the outcomes have been scientifically vetted. Touch has been found, among other things, to reduce stress, heart rate and blood pressure. Touch has even been found to lower the level of cortisol in the body (especially in women) which, when elevated, impedes our working memory and, most critically, the immune system’s resiliency. It should be great news that something free, widely available and lacking in harmful side effects is so good for us, but it gets ignored in a touch-averse culture like ours.'' Discusses how men handle stress more poorly than women, by growing stoic or "cowboy" in the face of stress. Women get higher levels of oxytocin when stressed which enhances their ability to cope. But both men and women get higher oxytocin levels through affectionate touch. This "gender role stress" doesn't make men more resilient, it makes then more vulnerable to anxiety and depression, and prevents them from feeling like they should seek mental help. Thus they develop more stress-related disorders like hypertension, alcohol, and drug abuse.},

% Uh, nice, but this doesn't jive with other stuff I've seen that suggests that women are twice as likely to have anxiety disorders and more likely than men to have depression.

  journal={The New York Times},
  date={2002-04-04},
  comment={Scientists find that there is only a slightly elevated risk of genetic diseases in children born of first cousins. While elevated it is not a risk at all that would preclude those couples from having children. This is not to be confused with incest --- sex between siblings or parents --- which is thought to have a much higher risk of genetic disease. (Though apparently as of this article in 2002 it sounds like nobody had actually studied that.) The risk to first cousins is far less than the risk of some parents who simply have a genetic disease, and ethically those people are not told they shouldn't have children. In other cultures it is considered preferable to marry a first cousin. The US has some kind of hangup, possibly beause of the eugenics movement which flourished in the US in the first part of the 20th century. Many states (as of 2002) have laws against marrying first cousins, and people are told by local doctors they shouldn't have children, but those doctors are misinformed.},

Right- and left-handers have coexisted at least since the Upper Palaeolithic, and left-handers are in the minority in all human populations. The persistence of the polymorphism of handedness is a puzzle because this trait is substantially heritable and several fitness costs are associated with left-handedness. Some countervailing benefit is required to maintain the polymorphism. Left-handers may have a frequency-dependent advantage in fights--the advantage being greater when their frequency is lower. Sports data from Western societies are consistent with this prediction. Here, we show that the frequency of left-handers is strongly and positively correlated with the rate of homicides across traditional societies. It ranges from 3\% in the most pacifistic societies, to 27\% in the most violent and warlike. This finding is consistent with a frequency-dependent selection mechanism maintaining left-handedness in these societies.},

Instead humans resisted for thousands of years the drag into civilization because the hunter gatherer life was so much better. Jared Diamond calls the move to agriculture the worst mistake in human history. Agriculture rose with cereal grains specifically because they were easy to tax, while other foods like breadfruit or plantain were not. Taxation led to writing, to keep lists of who has paid, and writing and cereals led to an elite ruling class, and thus civilization --- at the cost of slave labor and a decreased quality of life for most people.},

% On fire: In “Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States,” James C. Scott, a professor of political science at Yale, presents a plausible contender for the most important piece of technology in the history of man. It is a technology so old that it predates Homo sapiens and instead should be credited to our ancestor Homo erectus. That technology is fire. We have used it in two crucial, defining ways. The first and the most obvious of these is cooking. As Richard Wrangham has argued in his book “Catching Fire,” our ability to cook allows us to extract more energy from the food we eat, and also to eat a far wider range of foods. Our closest animal relative, the chimpanzee, has a colon three times as large as ours, because its diet of raw food is so much harder to digest. The extra caloric value we get from cooked food allowed us to develop our big brains, which absorb roughly a fifth of the energy we consume, as opposed to less than a tenth for most mammals’ brains. That difference is what has made us the dominant species on the planet.
% The other reason fire was central to our history is less obvious to contemporary eyes: we used it to adapt the landscape around us to our purposes. Hunter-gatherers would set fires as they moved, to clear terrain and make it ready for fast-growing, prey-attracting new plants. They would also drive animals with fire. They used this technology so much that, Scott thinks, we should date the human-dominated phase of earth, the so-called Anthropocene, from the time our forebears mastered this new tool.
% We don’t give the technology of fire enough credit, Scott suggests, because we don’t give our ancestors much credit for their ingenuity over the long period—ninety-five per cent of human history—during which most of our species were hunter-gatherers. “Why human fire as landscape architecture doesn’t register as it ought to in our historical accounts is perhaps that its effects were spread over hundreds of millennia and were accomplished by ‘precivilized’ peoples also known as ‘savages,’ ” Scott writes. To demonstrate the significance of fire, he points to what we’ve found in certain caves in southern Africa. The earliest, oldest strata of the caves contain whole skeletons of carnivores and many chewed-up bone fragments of the things they were eating, including us. Then comes the layer from when we discovered fire, and ownership of the caves switches: the human skeletons are whole, and the carnivores are bone fragments. Fire is the difference between eating lunch and being lunch.

  date={2012-06-17},
  comment={Argues that we need to develop a culture of ethical questioning of the decision to have children. Similar to the way we decide whether to buy a house or not. At the moment, the burden is on people who choose NOT to have children to explain themselves. ``In fact, people are still expected to provide reasons not to have children, but no reasons are required to have them. It’s assumed that if individuals do not have children it is because they are infertile, too selfish or have just not yet gotten around to it. In any case, they owe their interlocutor an explanation. On the other hand, no one says to the proud parents of a newborn, Why did you choose to have that child? What are your reasons? The choice to procreate is not regarded as needing any thought or justification.'' ``Such a question also profoundly affects the well-being of existing people (the potential parents, siblings if any, and grandparents). And it has effects beyond the family on the broader society, which is inevitably changed by the cumulative impact — on things like education, health care, employment, agriculture, community growth and design, and the availability and distribution of resources — of individual decisions about whether to procreate.'' ``Perhaps people fail to see childbearing as an ethical choice because they think of it as the expression of an instinct or biological drive, like sexual attraction or “falling in love,” that is not amenable to ethical evaluation. But whatever our biological inclinations may be, many human beings do take control over their fertility, thanks to contemporary means of contraception and abortion.'' ``My aim, I hasten to add, is not to argue for policing people’s procreative motives. I am simply arguing for the need to think systematically and deeply about a fundamental aspect of human life.  The burden of proof — or at least the burden of justification — should therefore rest primarily on those who choose to have children, not on those who choose to be childless.'' ``Because children are dependent, needy and vulnerable, prospective parents should consider how well they can love and care for the offspring they create, and the kind of relationship they can have with them. The genuinely unselfish life plan may at least sometimes be the choice not to have children, especially in the case of individuals who would otherwise procreate merely to adhere to tradition, to please others, to conform to gender conventions, or to benefit themselves out of the inappropriate expectation that children will fix their problems. Children are neither human pets nor little therapists.''},

It gets confusing: The federal government, partly at the behest of an underhanded corporation, sabotaged a community of hardworking and benevolent utopians — but only to create something fundamentally idealistic and to protect an irreplaceable ecological wonder from capitalistic loggers. And yet, the loggers were the utopians. The capitalists were socialists! Which would have been fine, except that the government had mistaken them for an underhanded corporation. Baffled, I called William Tweed, the retired Sequoia park ranger, who has also written about the colony. “You reach a stage in life where what you most frequently see in history is irony,” Tweed told me sagely. “Perhaps the lesson for 2017 is that ideology rarely explains what happens.”'' },

  category={Science, natural selection, evolution, sexual selection},
}
% At first I was thinking: how could people who have been breeding animals for thousands of years not realize that natural selection was going on.
% Darwin actually answers this question: breeders up to the 19th century always thought they were making choices to mix breeds that were separately decsended from wile breeds. Unconsciously the selected the most fit animasls from their stock for breeding, but with most animals it was difficult to see change to the breed within a human lifetime.
% What this suggests most to me is how deeply ingrained in our thinking natural selection is now in a post-darwin world that I just assumed breeders should have realized this.
% Another interesing thing is that Darwin is careful to cite influences and sources. He makes it very clear that he is the person who best articulated a theory that had been boiling for some time. It is not at all that he just popped this thing out of his head, he just put all the pieces together. The theory evolved.
% In arguing that there is no difference between what 19th century scientists were call "species" and "varieties" he points out that while most of the scientists were focussing on the similarties of animals, chunking them together into "species" he wanted to focus on the small differences that set them apart - for those small differences are the things that he believed led to new species. Page 45
% This is interesting: it suggests that paying attention to the details, not being lured in by the larger themes that may already exist in the general thought of the culture you are in, may lead you to a whole new set of larger themes.
% 19th century science is a really different thing: it still has elements of statistics, but it's really about _observation_. While modern science is essentially nothing but statistics.
% I think we still try to sell kids on the idea that science is observation - "experiments" are bubbling beakers or setting various things on fire to see what would happen, or disecting things to see how they work. This is a very 19th century version of science and has little (though not completely nothing) to do with the statistics and math based science of modern times that is actually fairly dull in everyday practice.
% He refers to shipwrecked sailors near shore - how it's better for strong swimmers to be stronger, and for weak swimmers to be weaker (and so stay with the wreck). ~Page 105
% He talks about how it is known among domestic animals that they vary purely in reaction to climate: like dogs growing a thicker coat in the cold. But he thinks that is a small effect compared to natural variation responding to climate.
% Darwin says that science can't be responsive to vox populi vox dei. He gives the example that science had to recognize that the earth revolves around the sun, not the other way around, even if popular opinion was otherwise.
% A thing that comes up over and over again with Darwin is the SCALE of time required for natural selection (he never says "evolution") to take place. This is another area where part of our blindness to this theory is the difficulty of humans to deal with the sheer scale of geological time scales.
% Reading Darwin in the light of Patrick O'Brian really makes you think about disection. Darwin often includes descriptions of viscera that border on gross.
% Darwin doesn't really have much trouble with the eye. But the electric organs of fish, on the other hand, creates a real problem. Page 139
% He says other authors have a view of nature "like a toy store" wity variety for varieties sake. Page 142. Though this does make one wonder if perhaps the variety IS there for the entertainment... of _someone_.
% I start to wonder about the effect of inheritance, which D does mention briefly. Consider the fact that so many mammals have 5 bones in their "fingers" adapted in a billion ways. (See page 147.)  But why five? Obviously if growing a sixth finger helps a species, it will happen, but in most cases they just have 5 because that's what their ancestors had. And then those 5 evolve into wings or flippers or whatever, where essentially there is only 1 or 2 digits for functional purposes. Those digits might just as easily contained 3 or 8 bone structures. - see page 334 where he kind of picks this topic up.
% Darwin points out that flowers are beautiful soley to catch the eye of the insect in a field of green. (Page 147)
% Darwin says, "I may first remark that this sense of beauty obviously depends on the nature of the mind, irrespective of any real quality in the admired object; and that idea of what is beautiful, is not innate or unalterable. We see this, for instance, in the men of different races admiring an entirely differeny standard of beauty in their women." Page 147.
% I do believe that biologists, when examining some funky part or behavior an animal evoled, almost immediately fall back on it being for obtaining food or sex.
% I think this is an equivalent simplistic understanding of the world as the "rational actor" is of economics.
% Think of play - it isn't for food or sex. But it allows the animal to develop it's brain, (which granted, might yield more food later). The behavior is directly for nothing more than fun. Periods of rest are similar. They have long-term benefits for food or sex, but the immediate benefit might be pleasure, social company, or entertainment. We KNOW animals get bored - think of pets left home alone. Why do biologists never think that might be part of an animals behavior in the wild? Or that animals might evolve structures that are part of their entertainment behavior?

% There's also structures that remain from some use in the past, sometimes repurposed for other uses.
% And there's simply individual preferences. A single individual might have ANY kind of bahvior (it would be part of the variation of natural selection). I think biologists DO understand that though.
% Natural selection is a simple concept in stating that species develop useful characteristics to survive better than their competitors. It is complex because the rules of the competition are not always clear to humans with their short life-spans and limited fossil record. Particularly in the use of energy: a person might say: why didn't an animal evolve some kind of ranged weapon? or some other fantastical device. But there's two big reasons it didn't: one it had to come from something that already existed, and two there is not unlimited energy to power new structures. This is why disued structures tend to fade away too. One big factor often overlooked: how much energy is available to power the development of a new structure.
% It's funny that humans have such a poor undersanding of energy consumption as a part of animal life. (See bike racing.) One would think that it would be an inherently instinctive thing. And maybe it is at some deep physical level. But we have not conscious recognition of it.
% D says "the most serious special difficulty my theory has encountered" is the problem of neuter insects (not the eye). That is, worker ants who evolved special adaptations like extra armor or giant jaws, but are neuter and can't pass on their adaptation to offspring.
% His conclusion (I assume rightly) is that the worker ants themselves could be seen as adaptations of the the fertile ants. This is possible among social animals (already you can see early hints at thinking of any colonies as a whole organism, not individuals). For social animals it is possible to have sterile workers who develop special adaptations because those sterile individuals help the fertile ones to flourish. He also includes here a funny example of degrees of variation by talking about construction workers who might be from 5 to 15 feet high, wich giant jaws and heads.
% See page 205 and nearby pages in chapter on instincts.
% The instincts chapter also includes some neat descriptions of the cuckoo's habit of laying eggs in other bird's next and pushing the other bird's young out of the nest. And also detailed descriptions of slave making ants.
% He briefly mentions in the instinct chapter the ant habit of farming aphids. Even he calls the aphids "cattle". The fact that ants are carrying out agriculture is not missed by him.
% (In this edition) Darwin mentions Archaeopteryx on page 251
% Darwin struggles with the age of the earth. He is up against the current thinking that the Earth is relatively young (vs today's standards) thousands or millions of years old. Darwin tries to epmhasize how long a million years is. He says that huge amounts of time must have been necessary for natural seleciton to occur - he suggests many millions if not hundreds of millions of years. Little does he suspect that the scales he is talking about are far smaller than reality - BILLIONS of years.
% This was written long before the theory of plate tectonics, and that causes Darwin some trouble trying to explain why different species are very similar in very different places. But he does suggest that maybe the oceans the continents have not always been where they are now. Page 276
% Darwin proposed two be challenges to a species success that evolution has to overcome: the nature of the environment into a which a species moves, and other species against which it has to competete. At the time he was writing, a LOT of stock was put into being fit for a new environment. But Darwin argues that it is actually competition that matters most. He saw this in the Galapagos. P. 311
% [Origin is a good example of how to "write the book" on something. The theory is broad and very generalized. The kind of thing you could come up with sitting around your sitting room. It fits well, and makes sense, but there are also lots of exceptions, some of which Darwin can't explain (in some cases because the science just wasn't there to support him yet - like plate tectonics and the age the Earth). Being broad and not always working doesn't matter though. What makes it convincing, is years and years of examples collected and applied. If one wanted to write a book that changes the whole way people see the world, with lasting impacts, this is a good model.]
% There's some interesting comment on hair, beards, and skin color towards the end of Descent of Man.
% "When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a long history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, in the same way as any great mechanical invention is the summing up of the labor, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from experience, does the study of natural history become!" Page 371
% Darwin's ideas of sexual selection were largely ignored until the 1980s, scientists assumes that natural selection actually accounted for sexual selection, in complicated ways - like bright feathers signaled a healthy immune system or something. Further research indicated that while this was sometimes true, more often sexual selection was happening for traits that couldn't really be explained as natural selection. Richard Prum put forth a theory in the 1980s that animals made choices that affect their evolution based on beauty, and that there is no way to understand why certain things would be regarded as beautiful by animals. More modern thinking is that sexual selection is driven by a number of mechanisms, not least that sometimes environment and perception of the enviornment shape what animals value and select for.

% ``one particular aspect of his argument is his distress at the idea that almost all evolutionary change is assumed to be adaptive, contributing to fitness. In other words, if a fish is blue, it must be blue for a reason. The color must help it escape predators or sneak up on prey, or be otherwise useful in some way. Beauty, therefore, must be adaptive, or a sign of underlying qualities that are adaptive. Pick a behavior or an ornament or a physical trait, and it is useful until proven otherwise. That’s backward, says Dr. Prum. Take beauty. Since animals have aesthetic preferences and make choices, beauty will inevitably appear. “Beauty happens,” as he puts it, and it should be taken as nonadaptive until proven otherwise.''

  comment={Argues that having a scientific mindset doesn't preclude the possibility that there is some higher force (god, aliens, whatever) that set up evolution to try to achieve something, and may occasionally intervene. Interstingly points out that Stephen Jay Gould did his best to argue that there is no purpose to evolution. ``This is the best, the most interesting experiment they could set up: to set up the evolution on Planet Earth going in such a way that it would produce these really interesting characters — humans who go around doing things — and they watch their experiment, interfering hardly at all so that almost everything we do comes out according to the laws of nature. But every now and then they see something which doesn’t look quite right — this zoo is going to kill itself off if they let you do this or that.” So, he continued, these extraterrestrials “insert a finger and just change some little thing. And maybe those are the miracles which the religious people like to so emphasize.”'' },

% While I gnerally agree with this, there's a couple of problems:
# 1 - this is a classic example of philosophers arguing/thinknig about stuff that is fundamentally unknowable. Who cares if higher forces are occasionally interveneing in our lives if there's no way to know if it's true or not? Just acknowledge the possibility and move on.
% 2 - Who says the higher purpose is GOOD? To make the experiment "interesting" would mean keeping it from collapsing - potentially seen as a "good" - but also possibly stirring the pot: say by making Trump president.
% We as humans really WANT our lives to be meaningful, to serve some "higher purpose" but while Gould might be wrong that evolution is completely random, maybe what he sees as "random" is actually a higher purpose that want both good and bad things to happen - because they, like us, would find only good things happening to be terrifically dull.

  category={Humanity, civil war, death}
}
% She frames killing and dying as "work" and that killing demanded the "harder courage". Page 32
% A lot of this book is about Civil War-era folks desparately trying to maintain their Christian beliefs in the face of the horrors of war. Particularly regarding the idea of "the good death" where the dying indicates in some way that they are surely going on to the after life.
% Traditionally the good death would have happened at home, surrounded by friends and family who could see the dying as they passed on to the afterlife. The war forced many many men to die far from home, and so a lot of this book is taken up with various ways families resolved that: through the development of embalming and special caskets, accounts of last words on the battle fields, or even last letters from the dying. But sometimes this war in an era that was becoming industrial would just completely disintegrate some men. Many just disappeared entirely.
% Spiritualism became huge during the war because of this - many cults and people believed they could talk to the dead. Mediums sprang up, one magazine even published regular messages from beyond the grave (for a very long time after the war ended too). The planchette was developed - an early version of the ouiji board - a parlor game which people could buy and play to communicate with the dead. Page 182
% There's some interesting ideas mentioned in here (I've lost the page references) to the timeless fact that men felt most alive in battles, and that the will to go into battle is primarily derived from the sense of duty to the other men in their immediate circle of the war. This suggests interesting things about men in gangs in cities - it's potentially the same things that would have to be overcome - the sense that this is their MOST alive time of life, and commitment to their friends above all else - even family, country, religion.
% She says that Paul Fussell says wars always beget irony because intentions are always overturned by circumstance. Wars outcome is always much more horrible than we can anticipate. Page 194.

% I have already spoken of the importance of maps and books of reference,
% and these should include a good encyclopaedia and dictionaries, English,
% Latin and Greek. Oates was generally deep in Napier's History of the
% Peninsular War, and some of us found Herbert Paul's History of Modern
% England a great stand-by. Most of us managed to find room in our
% personal gear when sledging for some book which did not weigh much and
% yet would last. Scott took some Browning on the Polar Journey, though I
% only saw him reading it once; Wilson took Maud and In Memoriam; Bowers
% always had so many weights to tally and observations to record on
% reaching camp that I feel sure he took no reading matter. Bleak House
% was the most successful book I ever took away sledging, though a volume
% of poetry was useful, because it gave one something to learn by heart
% and repeat during the blank hours of the daily march, when the idle
% mind is all too apt to think of food in times of hunger, or possibly
% of purely imaginary grievances, which may become distorted into real
% foundations of discord under the abnormal strain of living for months
% in the unrelieved company of three other men. If your companions have
% much the same tastes as yourself it is best to pool your allowance of
% weights and take one book which will offer a wide field of thought and
% discussion. I have heard Scott and Wilson bless the thought which led
% them to take Darwin's Origin of Species on their first Southern Journey.
% Such is the object of your sledging book, but you often want the book
% which you read for half an hour before you go to sleep at Winter
% Quarters to take you into the frivolous fripperies of modern social life
% which you may not know and may never wish to know, but which it is often
% pleasant to read about, and never so much so as when its charms are so

% The word tattoo enters the English language when Cook visits Tahiti, page 78 
% The idea of cannibalism (particularly in the south pacific) enters Western consciousness when Cook visits New Zealand, page 104  
% "Kangaroo" was long thought to be a misinterpretation by Cook and Banks of the word said by the aboriginals. Right into modern times it was told that "kangaroo" meant something like "what did you say?" But in fact Cook and Banks got a list of common words from the local aboriginals, and they were fairly accurate, including the term for the animal. Page, 124 
% On a later visit to New Zealand, during the second voyage, the Maori horrified the Europeans by eating the flesh of a young boy they had killed in battle. ...Then Cook and another crew member ask the Moari to do it again, (to prove for certain that they partake in cannibalism) and even slice off and cook the meat on the ship.
% The book points out that while the Moari do sometimes eat the flesh of enemies killed in battle, it probably wasn't super common. Another aspect of the Moari culture is to do things that are intimidating or defy conventions for the pleasure of doing it. As in their haka war dance. It is very likely that they were eating the flesh FOR the Europeans, essentially to freak them out. Page 211
% The OTHER ship on Cook's second voyage (not with Cook on board) was long separated from Cook. On landing at New Zealand there was an incident where one of the boats of that ship went off to meet islanders at Grass Cove, insulted them, were all killed and eaten. Later their cooked parts were discovered by other members of that ship. page 252
% The search for the Northwest Passage was predicated on the (false) belief that seawater doesn't freeze. (Elsewhere, it's explained that when seawater freezes, it precipitates out the salt, so melted seawater yields fresh water.) Since it was believed that ice in the north and south only came from nearby freshwater rivers, it was also believed that a Northwest Passage could exist. Cook's third voyage was sent out to find it.

  year={1999},
  publisher={WW Norton \& Company},
  comment = {From wikipedia: ``The book attempts to explain why Eurasian civilizations (including North Africa) have survived and conquered others, while arguing against the idea that Eurasian hegemony is due to any form of Eurasian intellectual, moral, or inherent genetic superiority. Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental differences, which are amplified by various positive feedback loops. When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, written language or the development among Eurasians of resistance to endemic diseases), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian genomes.''},

% I read this a long time ago. I remember it as being the first place that I read about how the decline of megafauna coincides with the arrival of humans in most places.
% I know that theory is debated, but as David Attenborough put it, it is likely the arrival of humans at least had a PART in the extinction of megafauna.
% Which makes me feel that that fact, plus our human connection to cooking, really suggests that we as a species are BUILT to hunt, kill, cook, and eat giant land animals.
% That's not to dismiss the horrors of factory farming. But I think we lose some of our humanity by not eating wooly mammoths and aurochs.
% On domestication:
% I do also remember from this book that Diamond figures out that there are actually very few species of animal that COULD be domesticated world wide, and Europeans were lucky enough to have access to a bunch of them.
% In addition I remember that the domestication of corn and wheat played a big part in humans wiping out lots of other species.

  comment={From the prologue: ``This book employs the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which environmental problems contribute. My previous book (Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies), had applied the comparative method to the opposite problem: the differing rates of buildup of human societies on different continents over the last 13,000 years. In the present book focusing on collapses rather than buildups, I compare many past and present societies that differed with respect to environmental fragility, relations with neighbors, political institutions, and other "input" variables postulated to influence a society's stability. The "output" variables that I examine are collapse or survival, and form of the collapse if collapse does occur. By relating output variables to input variables, I aim to tease out the influence of possible input variables on collapses.''},

% In most cultures throughout history human men go out and hunt and
% women stay home and gather. But while Wrangham pins this division on
% fire (men had more time to hunt while women cooked) you could see it
% equally as being spurred by something else - say women were more
% interested in gathering because it's a more reliable food source - and
% they need to feed their babies (cooked or not) while men are willing
% to starve a little for a tastier unreliable food source (cooked or
% not). This also doesn't clearly carry well to the male-female partner
% bonding that Wrangham claims comes from cooking (men protect women
% from other men while they cook, he says). There are just too many
% different variations on this in different cultures, human interactions
% are just too complex to pin this on cooking alone. For example there
% are many tribes that have whole groups of people living together,

  comment = {Book review about books on animal intelligence. ``Prior to the domestication of plants and the invention of writing, the differences between human societies and those of elephants, dogs, killer whales, and dolphins was a matter of degree, not kind.'' ``The best wolves are brilliant leaders that pursue lifelong strategies in order to lead their families to success. According to wolf watchers, the greatest wolf Yellowstone has ever known was Twenty-one (wolf researchers use numbers rather than names for individuals). He was big and brave, once taking on six attacking wolves and routing them all. He never lost a fight, but he was also magnanimous, for he never killed a vanquished enemy. And that made him as unusual among wolves as did his size and strength.'' ``And human clans willing to tolerate the wolves would have obtained valuable warnings of the presence of danger from other animals (and other humans). Eventually, Safina says, “we became like each other.” The partnership, however, has had some puzzling effects. The brains of dogs, as well as humans, have shrunk since we began living together, perhaps because we came to rely on each other rather than solely on our own wits.'' ``Because female killer whales can live up to eighty years, around a quarter of females in any group are postreproductive. Yet they remain sexually active. Grandmothers are evidently very important in killer whale societies, almost certainly because of the wisdom they have gathered over a lifetime.'' ``At times, killer whales have developed special relationships with people. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, at Twofold Bay south of Sydney, Australia, killer whales and humans set up a mutually profitable whaling enterprise. The killer whales would notify the whalers of the presence of humpback whales by performing a ritual in the waters of the bay fronting the whaler’s cottagers. The men would harpoon the humpbacks, and the killer whales would hold on to the harpoon ropes to tire the prey.  After a humpback was lanced and killed by the men, they observed the “law of the tongue.” The whalers would leave the humpback body for twenty-four hours so that the killers could feast on the lips and tongue. Remarkable proof of this partnership persists, in the form of the skeleton of “Old Tom”—a killer whale whose teeth were worn flat on one side while holding onto harpoon ropes—which can be seen in the killer whale museum in the town of Eden, Australia.'' ``With the exception of our species, killer whales are earth’s most capable predators. When they evolved ten million years ago, half of earth’s whales, seals, and dugong species became extinct.''},

  Title={What Is P-Value (in Layman Terms)?},
  journal={dzone.com},
  date={2018-09-05},
  comment={A nice (rare) plain-language explanation of p-value.},
  category={Science, statistics, p-value}
}

% To understand what p-value is, you first need to understand what a null
% hypothesis is. When running a hypothesis test/experiment, the null hypothesis
% says that there is no difference or no change between the two tests. The
% alternate hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis and states that
% there is a difference between the two tests. The goal of the experiment is
% usually to disprove the null hypothesis, and to prove/test the alternate
% hypothesis. Let me illustrate this with some examples.
% 
% If you are trying to test whether a new marketing campaign generates more
% revenue, the null hypothesis is that there is no change in the revenue as a
% result of the new marketing campaign. And the alternate hypothesis is that the
% new marketing campaign performs better (or worse) than the previous campaign.
% If you are trying to prove that a new drug lowers cholesterol, the null
% hypothesis states that there is no difference in cholesterol between the group
% with the drug and the group without, while the alternate hypothesis states that
% the new drug does have an effect on cholesterol levels. If you are trying to
% test whether a new server version has better or worse performance than the
% previous version, the null hypothesis is that both server versions have equal
% performance. And the alternate hypothesis is that there is a meaningful
% difference in the performance of the old and new server.
% 
% So what is the simple layman's definition of p-value? The p-value is the
% probability that the null hypothesis is true. That's it.
% 
% In the example where we are trying to test whether a new marketing campaign
% generates more revenue, the p-value is the probability that the null
% hypothesis, which states that there is no change in the revenue as a result of
% the new marketing campaign, is true. If the value of the p-value is 0.25, then
% there is a 25% probability that there is no real increase or decrease in
% revenue as a result of the new marketing campaign. If the value of the p-value
% is 0.04 then there is a 4% probability that there is no real increase or
% decrease in revenue as a result of the new marketing campaign. As you can
% surmise, the lower the p-value, the more confident we are that the alternate
% hypothesis is true, which, in this case, means that the new marketing campaign
% causes an increase or decrease in revenue.

Until now, no individual taxa have been suggested as distinct and characteristic new morphospecies representing this change. Here we show that the domestic broiler chicken is one such potential marker. Human-directed changes in breeding, diet and farming practices demonstrate at least a doubling in body size from the late medieval period to the present in domesticated chickens, and an up to fivefold increase in body mass since the mid-twentieth century. Moreover, the skeletal morphology, pathology, bone geochemistry and genetics of modern broilers are demonstrably different to those of their ancestors. Physical and numerical changes to chickens in the second half of the twentieth century, i.e. during the putative Anthropocene Epoch, have been the most dramatic, with large increases in individual bird growth rate and population sizes. Broiler chickens, now unable to survive without human intervention, have a combined mass exceeding that of all other birds on Earth; this novel morphotype symbolizes the unprecedented human reconfiguration of the Earth's biosphere. },

What we see and experience in our dreams might not necessarily be real, but the emotions attached to these experiences certainly are. Our dream stories essentially try to strip the emotion out of a certain experience by creating a memory of it. This way, the emotion itself is no longer active.  This mechanism fulfils an important role because when we don’t process our emotions, especially negative ones, this increases personal worry and anxiety. In fact, severe REM sleep-deprivation is increasingly correlated to the development of mental disorders. In short, dreams help regulate traffic on that fragile bridge which connects our experiences with our emotions and memories.''},

We examined the relative roles of natural selection, genetic drift and gene flow in influencing the evolution of white clover (Trifolium repens), which thrives in urban and rural areas. Trifolium repens exhibits a Mendelian polymorphism for the production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a potent antiherbivore defence. We quantified the relative frequency of HCN in 490 populations sampled along urban{\textendash}rural transects in 20 cities. We also characterized genetic variation within 120 populations in eight cities using 16 microsatellite loci. HCN frequency increased by 0.6\% for every kilometre from an urban centre, and the strength of this relationship did not significantly vary between cities. Populations did not exhibit changes in genetic diversity with increasing urbanization, indicating that genetic drift is unlikely to explain urban{\textendash}rural clines in HCN frequency. Populations frequently exhibited isolation-by-distance and extensive gene flow along most urban{\textendash}rural transects, with the exception of a single city that exhibited genetic differentiation between urban and rural populations. Our results show that urbanization repeatedly drives parallel evolution of an ecologically important trait across many cities that vary in size, and this evolution is best explained by urban{\textendash}rural gradients in natural selection.},

  Title={Wind Chill Blows},

  date={2010-01-07},
  comment={Why wind chill is a meaningless number. The initial experiments that led to wind chill calculations were grossly wrong. Around year 2000 some scientists tried to update it, but still made assumptions that apply to almost no one: ``Osczevski and Bluestein made a set of new assumptions to determine wind-chill-equivalent temperatures. Namely, they geared their calculations toward people who are 5 feet tall, somewhat portly, and walk at an even clip directly into the wind. They also left out crucial variables that have an important effect on how we experience the weather, like solar radiation. Direct sunlight can make us feel 10 to 15 degrees warmer, even on a frigid winter day. The wind chill equivalent temperature, though, assumes that we're taking a stroll in the dead of night.'' But even if they created a more accurate model, wind chill doesn't really tell you how cold your skin will get - that is air temperature alone - just the RATE at which your skin will reach air temperature. You'll feel colder FASTER in a stiff wind, but it isn't actually any COLDER. -40 with still air is far far colder than -10 with -40 wind chill. Argues that the best way to understand how weather will affect us is to simply look out the window. Weathermen can give us data, but each of us as individuals have to understand how that affects us alone.},

  comment={Covers the scientific phenomenon of "the decline effect" (a term re-coined in this article). This is where in some cases rigorous scientific study shows a declining effect over time, the more studies are done or replicated about a given finding. Recounts the story of Jonathan Schooler (also told in a RadioLab short) where his finding that the more people try to put a memory into words, the less accurate they are about the memory. (He calls it "verbal overshadowing".) But his findings were less robust the more he studied the phenomenon. Various explanations are floated, including regression to the mean (but it doesn't explain linear decline, it only explains a single extraordinary finding), and publication bias, where scientists tend to publish only positive findings (though this doesn't explain Schooler and a few other's rigorous findings.) It could also be perception bias - where even good scientists make mistakes that trend positive because they are human doing very very complex measurements. Scientists are also affected by cultural factors: in Asia 47 studies of acupuncture all found it effective, while of 94 studies of acupuncture in Western countries only 56 percent found it effective. This article also quotes John Ioannidis, who describes "significance chasing" where scientists try to find ways to get their findings over the 95 percent significance boundary. (A boundary which this article claims was basically an arbitrary boundary.) He says the pursuit of replicability distracts from the real problem: faulty experiment design.},

% According to Wikipedia this article caused a lot of controversy because the ending might suggest the scientific process doesn't work: "Just because an idea is true doesn’t mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn’t mean it’s true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe."
% Lehrer responded to these criticisms by reinforcing that theories like evolution and global warming are real. The scientific method works - when enough studies are applied to it.
% RadioLab and On The Media covered this, and raised the possible explanation as some larger problem with the universe in general - maybe something like the act of observing phenomena actually changes the results. This of course is only a theory, that could only be a real possibility if the other explanations are more firmly eliminated.
% Wikipedia covers some of the controversy around this article, pointing out that most of the studies showing the decline effect are in areas of social science, that involve humans - who are notoriously more complex to study. Harder sciences, like physics, have less of this issue.
% There is little follow up to this article and criticism that I can find 8 years later. It seems like this blew up as a controversy for a short while, and then most people forgot about it.

We analyzed the bacterial microbiome of used kitchen sponges by 454{\^a}??pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes and fluorescence in situ hybridization coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy (FISH{\^a}??CLSM). Pyrosequencing showed a relative dominance of Gammaproteobacteria within the sponge microbiota. Five of the ten most abundant OTUs were closely related to risk group 2 (RG2) species, previously detected in the BE and kitchen microbiome. Regular cleaning of sponges, indicated by their users, significantly affected the microbiome structure. Two of the ten dominant OTUs, closely related to the RG2-species Chryseobacterium hominis and Moraxella osloensis, showed significantly greater proportions in regularly sanitized sponges, thereby questioning such sanitation methods in a long term perspective. FISH{\^a}??CLSM showed an ubiquitous distribution of bacteria within the sponge tissue, concentrating in internal cavities and on sponge surfaces, where biofilm{\^a}??like structures occurred. Image analysis showed local densities of up to 5.4{\^a}??*{\^a}??1010 cells per cm3, and confirmed the dominance of Gammaproteobacteria.

Redwoods grow straight up without any branches for 200 feet, and then in the canopys start splitting off into many different trunks and branches, which then fuse back together in places. Soil and plants collect on the branches and in the crevises in the canopy. Sometimes up to 3 feet thick. Worms and salamanders live up there. Other tiny trees and bushes grow in the soil. Some of the branches and trunks are dead making the climbing very dangerous. There can be dead wood sections the size of cars that can be knocked free by a climber. Sometimes redwoods drop whole section of themselve, which one scientist calls calving --- dropping a woodberg. },

Something similar occurred with remnants of the “Stuxnet” worm that the United States and Israel used against Iran’s nuclear program nearly seven years ago. Elements of those tools frequently appear in other, less ambitious attacks.'' ``The attacks on Friday are likely to raise significant questions about whether the growing number of countries developing and stockpiling cyberweapons can avoid having those same tools purloined and turned against their own citizens.  They also showed how easily a cyberweapon can wreak havoc, even without shutting off a country’s power grid or its cellphone network.'' Microsoft had released a patch for this, but while they usually credit the person who found the exploit, in this case it was anonymous, leading people to point the finger at the N.S.A. itself revealing the exploit to Microsoft because they knew it had been stolen from them. ``Privacy activists said if that were the case, the government would be to blame for the fact that so many companies were left vulnerable to Friday’s attacks. It takes time for companies to roll out systemwide patches, and by notifying Microsoft of the hole only after the N.S.A.’s hacking tool was stolen, activists say the government would have left many hospitals, businesses and governments susceptible.''},

  comment={New research shows that people often _understand_ the science around things like climate change, but choose not to believe it because it conflicts with their beliefs. The problem isn't a LACK of information, it's people CHOOSING not to believe it. ``more people know what scientists think about high-profile scientific controversies than polls suggest; they just aren’t willing to endorse the consensus when it contradicts their political or religious views. This finding helps us understand why my colleagues and I have found that factual and scientific evidence is often ineffective at reducing misperceptions and can even backfire on issues like weapons of mass destruction, health care reform and vaccines. With science as with politics, identity often trumps the facts.'' One possible solution is to try to break the connection between identity and factual beliefs --- so a Republican might still believe in climate change. But also there is a need to reduce incentives for elites to spread misinformation to their followers. ``Once people’s cultural and political views get tied up in their factual beliefs, it’s very difficult to undo regardless of the messaging that is used.'' ``The deeper problem is that citizens participate in public life precisely because they believe the issues at stake relate to their values and ideals, especially when political parties and other identity-based groups get involved – an outcome that is inevitable on high-profile issues. Those groups can help to mobilize the public and represent their interests, but they also help to produce the factual divisions that are one of the most toxic byproducts of our polarized era.''},

Most subsequent attine agricultural evolution, including the domestication event that produced the ancestor of higher attine cultivars, is likewise hypothesized to have occurred in South American rainforests. The {\textquoteleft}out-of-the-rainforest{\textquoteright} hypothesis, while generally accepted, has never been tested in a phylogenetic context. It also presents a problem for explaining how fungal domestication might have occurred,
given that isolation from free-living populations is required. Here, we use phylogenomic data from ultra-conserved element (UCE) loci to reconstruct the evolutionary history of fungus-farming
ants, reduce topological uncertainty, and identify the closest non-fungus-growing ant relative.
Using the phylogeny we infer the history of attine agricultural systems, habitat preference and
biogeography. Our results show that the out-of-the-rainforest hypothesis is correct with regard
to the origin of attine ant agriculture; however, contrary to expectation, we find that the transition from lower to higher agriculture is very likely to have occurred in a seasonally dry habitat, inhospitable to the growth of free-living populations of attine fungal cultivars. We suggest that dry habitats favoured the isolation of attine cultivars over the evolutionary time spans

% "Up to 1953 I had regarded as gospel everything that emanated from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the agricultural colleges" - A beekeeper in upstate NY after his bees died from insecticide spraying. Page 160
% In this you can kind of suspect that the left is just as, if not more, to blame for the distrust of government than the right.  You can see the seeds of NIMBYism, and the governmental paralysis that it would eventually spread.
% Carson does not make a very convincing case for the application of insecticides having impacts beyond the insects and the animals that eat them directly. (at least, as of page 160)
% She lays out a compelling case against broad-spectrum insecticides. But offers no real solutions other than importing predator insects from other places to eat pests. She suggests this multiple times throughout the book. As we know, that can be a really BAD idea.
% The real lesson, which she does eventually get to (Page 260) is that you can't just scale up a small technological solution and expect it to work and not have negative consequences. Humans LOVE to do this, because it's an easy way to put a lot of people to work without having to do much research or educating the users. (Think of the ancient methods of slash-and-burn farming for instance.)
% The problem is this is the brute-force solution, whether it's chemicals, or importing predators, or getting trains to run on time (see comments in article about subway countdown clocks (somerssubwayclocks) about management through understanding problems, rather than willpower.) 
% The best solution is to take the time to deeply understand a problem, and always ALWAYS apply the MINIMAL amount of work necessary to fix it. Educated, targeted solutions. This doesn't go well with democractic governance though because it not only can save money, but puts fewer people to work.

Today Google Maps seems, in the pejorative sense of the term, robotic: It simply accepts an explicit demand (the need to get from one place to another) and tries to satisfy that demand as efficiently as possible. The goal posts for “artificial intelligence” are thus constantly receding.'' ``For math and chess it [the old-fashioned AI approach] worked great, and the proponents of symbolic A.I. took it for granted that no activities signaled “general intelligence” better than math and chess.''},

Furthermore, microstimulation of this brain region evoked the same behavior. Just as
in humans, mood could modulate this neuronal activity. Anxiety-inducing situations suppressed the cells{\textquoteright} firing, and the animal could no longer be tickled.Science, this issue p. 757Rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations in response to tickling by humans. Tickling is rewarding through dopaminergic mechanisms, but the function and neural correlates of ticklishness are unknown. We confirmed that tickling of rats evoked vocalizations, approach, and unsolicited jumps (Freudenspr{\"u}nge). Recordings in the trunk region of the rat somatosensory cortex showed intense tickling-evoked activity in most neurons, whereas a minority of cells were suppressed by tickling. Tickling responses predicted nontactile neural responses to play behaviors, which suggests a neuronal link between tickling and play. Anxiogenic conditions suppressed tickling-evoked vocalizations and trunk cortex activity. Deep-layer trunk cortex neurons discharged
during vocalizations, and deep-layer microstimulation evoked vocalizations. Our findings provide evidence for deep-layer trunk cortex activity as a neural correlate of ticklishness.},

We provide the first spatially continuous map of forest tree density at a global scale. This map reveals that the global number of trees is approximately 3.04 trillion, an order of magnitude higher than the previous estimate. Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.61 trillion in temperate regions. Biome-level trends in tree density demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming effect of humans across most of the world. Based on our projected tree densities, we estimate that over 15 billion trees are cut down each year, and the global number of trees has fallen by approximately 46\% since the start of human civilization.},

Rather they found that the traies of higher cognitive ability, more educated parents, and better impulse control are better indicators for success, as demonstrated by decades of social science. Also insecurity actually detracted from success while emotional stability increased success. And there's no ``synergy'' between the traits of the trple package. This op-ed also addresses whether it is appropriate for scientists to engage with a pop-culture theory, and argue that they should. ``Professors Chua and Rubenfeld created a provocative theory, and they spun around it an intricate web of circumstantial evidence, but it did not stand up to direct empirical tests. Our conclusion regarding “The Triple Package” is expressed by the saying, “What is new is not correct, and what is correct is not new.”'' },

% It was interesting for these guys to take up the challenge of a psych-pop theory, and debunk it. I like that they address this issues of science's role in culture. Not fully addressed here is the fact that so much of science IS influenced by pop culture. Not just through pop culture putting forward theories that need testing (which probably actually get the smallest amount of scientific testing) but more from the influence of pop VALUES on what scientists decide to study.
% But really, is there any difference between a scientist writing a white paper to suggest something that should be studied, and some smart people putting out a book that suggests something that should be studied? I think the only problem really is that I'm sure the book is framed as something that is true, whereas it really should be framed as something that should be studied. But the scientists could be doing that work for pop culture. Engage with theories out there, and say, 'hey, that's interesting, we need to study this.'

Nearly a century ago, scientists began to realise that non-living systems could behave as self-organisers that ‘suck orderliness’ from their environment. That notion was formalised in the 1960s by the Russian chemist Ilya Prigogine, who called such self-organising systems dissipative structures. Such structures are easy to find: simply pull the plug in a bathtub and watch a whirlpool form. Driven by gravity, the water molecules spontaneously swirl into a pattern that is more ordered than their previous haphazard collection. Because it makes the water drain more quickly, the whirlpool increases global entropy by making a lower-entropy local structure. If the tub is continually filled at an equal rate – say by running the shower – the whirlpool will persist indefinitely. When energy can continuously flow through a system, interesting things begin to happen.''},

  comment = {Explains why understanding the brain can't be reduced to understanding a single component like neurons. Uses an example of how the smaller the scale of your measurements, the longer Britain's coastline becomes. Like the coastline the brain has a power law distribution, not a normal distribution, which means that is has no average (or specific thing) that could be the most powerful part or root of how it works. ``If power law distributions are so common in the brain, they must be telling us something about how it operates.  Why does the brain transcend bell-curve averages?  One possible explanation is that the brain lacks a privileged scale because its functioning cannot be reduced to component parts (i.e., neurons).  Rather, it is the complex interactions between parts which give rise to phenomena at all spatial and temporal scales. If this hypothesis is true, it does not bode well for the Blue Brain Project.  Like averages, reductionism is deeply ingrained in our scientific thinking.  Water is explained in terms of molecules, molecules in terms of atoms, etc.  If the brain is reducible to simpler parts, it should also exhibit a privileged scale of organization.'' `` A unifying mechanism for power law behavior in the brain and other systems is that of self-organized criticality (SOC).  According to this model, systems such as the brain operate on the brink of instability, exhibiting slow processes that build energy and fast processes that dissipate energy.  In such systems, small causes have effects of many sizes.''},

Here we describe a new and gigantic titanosaur, Dreadnoughtus schrani, from Upper Cretaceous sediments in southern Patagonia, Argentina. Represented by approximately 70\% of the postcranial skeleton, plus craniodental remains, Dreadnoughtus is the most complete giant titanosaur yet discovered, and provides new insight into the morphology and evolutionary history of these colossal animals. Furthermore, despite its estimated mass of about 59.3 metric tons, the bone histology of the Dreadnoughtus type specimen reveals that this individual was still growing at the time of death.},

Wheel running is often used in the laboratory for triggering enhanced activity levels, despite the common objection that this behaviour is an artefact of captivity and merely signifies neurosis or stereotypy. If wheel running is indeed caused by captive housing, wild mice are not expected to use a running wheel in nature. This however, to our knowledge, has never been tested. Here, we show that when running wheels are placed in nature, they are frequently used by wild mice, also when no extrinsic reward is provided. Bout lengths of running wheel behaviour in the wild match those for captive mice. This finding falsifies one criterion for stereotypic behaviour, and suggests that running wheel activity is an elective behaviour. In a time when lifestyle in general and lack of exercise in particular are a major cause of disease in the modern world, research into physical activity is of utmost importance. Our findings may help alleviate the main concern regarding the use of running wheels in research on exercise.},

That tax would offset the environmental costs, chiefly the greenhouse impact, and allow each municipality to make a guilt-free choice based on local economics and its citizens’ wishes.

This is a spectacular delusion.'' ``Put differently, the hope that we can empower intelligent people to positions where they can design the perfect set of regulations, or that we can rely on scientists to take the carbon out of the atmosphere and engineer sources of renewable energy, serves to cover over the simple fact that the work of saving the planet is political, not technical. We have a much better chance of making it past the 22nd century if environmental regulations are designed by a team of people with no formal education in a democratic socialist society than we do if they are made by a team of the most esteemed scientific luminaries in a capitalist society.

% This suggests that one should never doubt human intuition without very strong research. Humans are really good at recognizing patterns. If you are going to say that a pattern that many many humans revognize is wrong, you better have _damn_ good research to back it up.
% This is not to be confused with media-guided opinions though.

% Which explains that while the male orgasm is well understood - pleasure comes at the point of ejaculation driving the man to have sex - the female orgasm is a mystery because the clit is sparated from the vagina. New research suggests that other older species evolved with the clit inside the vagina, and the orgasm singnaled the release of the egg. But primates/humans developed social circles with regular sex so a signal to release the egg became unecessary and women evolved regular menstrual cycles. (So fascinating! Menstrual cycles exist because of the existence of _social_ structures!) The clitoris evolved away from the vagina to keep the singnals separate (this part is a little hard to believe.)

  abstract = {We test for a ‘hot hand’ (i.e., short-term streakiness in performance) in Major League Baseball using panel data. We find strong evidence for its existence in all ten statistical categories we consider. The magnitudes are significant; being ‘hot’ corresponds to roughly a one quartile increase in the distribution. Our results are in notable contrast to the majority of the hot hand literature, which has found little to no evidence for a hot hand in sports, often employing basketball shooting data. We argue that this difference is attributable to endogenous defensive responses: basketball presents sufficient opportunity for defensive responses to equate shooting probabilities across players whereas baseball does not. As such, prior evidence on the absence of a hot hand (despite widespread belief in its presence) should not be interpreted as a cognitive mistake – as it typically is in the literature – but rather as an efficient equilibrium adjustment. We provide a heuristic manner for identifying a priori which sports are likely to permit an equating endogenous response response and discuss potential implications for identifying the hot hand effect in other settings.},

However, identifying the direct effect of terrorism on economics and psychology is difficult because institutions also change in response to terrorist attacks.  This paper controls for institutional responses to terrorist attacks by studying people who live beyond the institutions' borders, but are exposed to the attacks.  I find that terrorism leads to declines in trust, subjective well-being, and the importance of creativity and freedom. However, at the macro-level, terrorism leads to increases in economic output and household income.  These results are consistent with a growing literature that finds counterintuitive responses to trauma.},

  comment={Argues that the US has an extremely high number of people living in deep poverty, comparable to some of the poorest countries on the planet. This is hidden by the statistics however. If deep poverty is living on less than 2 dollars a day in India, where it is warm and people can live outside, an dpeople don't need housing, child care, clothing or transportation to live, then in the US the number compared should be more like 4 dollars a day. Using this metric, there are 5.3 million Americans who live in absolute poverty by global standards. This is more than countries like Sierra Leone, Nepal, Senegal, and Angola. (Though is is an absolutel comparison, not a poverty _rate_.) This is not an argument that the US is the _worst_ just that it is a bad problem. Nor it it an argument against trying to help those overseas. Just that it has to be considered a problem here as well.},

A good example is Moore's Law. The number of researchers required today to achieve the famous doubling every two years of the density of computer chips is more than 18 times larger than the number required in the early 1970s. Across a broad range of case studies at various levels of (dis)aggregation, we find that ideas — and in particular the exponential growth they imply — are getting harder and harder to find. Exponential growth results from the large increases in research effort that offset its declining productivity.},

The idea of the rule is that very few people call those areas so higher fees don't matter.

This is called "traffic pumping." The cost is entirely born by the long distance carriers, since these days they generally charge a flat fee for unlimited long distance. When Google got into phone service with Google Voice in 2009, they balked against these fees and tried to raise awareness about them.

  journal={The New York Times},
  date={2017-05-13},
  comment={When men and women finish school and start working, they’re paid pretty much equally. The pay gap between genders widens as people age, spreading most sharply in their late 20s to mid 30s --- when many women have children. Unmarried women without children continue to earn closer to what men do. Even married women without children earn less, research shows, because women are more likely to give up job opportunities to either move or stay put for their husband’s job. Married women might also take less intensive jobs in preparation for children, or employers might not give them more responsibility because they assume they’ll have babies and take time off. Couples typically decide that the person who earns less should stay home and take care of the house. But that often ends up being the woman because she earns less because it is assumed she will end up staying home to take care of a household. Interestingly there is much less of a gap (about half as much) for people without college degrees. This is because earnings are higher and men dominate the highest-paying jobs. Also there is a strong emphasis on long inflexible hours.},

  comment={Wealthy people tend to share less of what they have with others. Possibly because money allows people to achieve their goals without depending on others, so it cultivates a mind-set of self-sufficiency that is at odds with charity. Poorer people are quicker to turn to their friends and family for help (with anything: moving, money, cleaning, whatever) while rich people will just hire someone. For this reason wealthy people teach their children to prioritize individuality, while poorer people focus on the needs of the group. Research suggests that taking this into account, it is easier to get rich people to donate to charity by catering to their sense of themselves. Meaning: ask wealthy people to "take individual action" rather than "contribute to the goals of the group." The researchers point out that we often want to change people to do things for the right reason, but really we just need them to do the right thing.},

The laws in Delaware and Nevada offer companies similar benefits as the laws in the British Virgin Islands.

We analyze the effect of the increase in industrial robot usage between 1990 and 2007 on US local labor markets. Using a model in which robots compete against human labor in the production of different tasks, we show that robots may reduce employment and wages, and that the local labor market effects of robots can be estimated by regressing the change in employment and wages on the exposure to robots in each local labor market—defined from the national penetration of robots into each industry and the local distribution of employment across industries. Using this approach, we estimate large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages across commuting zones. We bolster this evidence by showing that the commuting zones most exposed to robots in the post-1990 era do not exhibit any differential trends before 1990. The impact of robots is distinct from the impact of imports from China and Mexico, the decline of routine jobs, offshoring, other types of IT capital, and the total capital stock (in fact, exposure to robots is only weakly correlated with these other variables). According to our estimates, one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0.18-0.34 percentage points and wages by 0.25-0.5 percent. },

We compare these forecasts to those made by PhD students and non-experts: undergraduates, MBAs, and an online sample. We document seven main results. First, the average forecast of experts predicts quite well the experimental results. Second, there is a strong wisdom-of-crowds effect: the average forecast outperforms 96 percent of individual forecasts. Third, correlates of expertise---citations, academic rank, field, and contextual experience--do not improve forecasting accuracy. Fourth, experts as a group do better than non-experts, but not if accuracy is defined as rank ordering treatments. Fifth, measures of effort, confidence, and revealed ability are predictive of forecast accuracy to some extent, especially for non-experts. Sixth, using these measures we identify `superforecasters' among the non-experts who outperform the experts out of sample. Seventh, we document that these results on forecasting accuracy surprise the forecasters themselves.

  journal={The New York Times},
  date={2017-02-07},
  comment={Macroeconomics has been in a professional crisis since the 2007 financial crisis because they completely failed to predict the crisis. Preventing financial crises IS the job of macroeconomics, and they have proven time and again more or less incapable of doing that. ``Uniquely in the social sciences and humanities, macroeconomics was developed with a specific, real-world purpose, and a negative purpose to boot: to stop anything like the Great Depression from ever happening again. Given this goal — to avert systemic crises and downturns — the credit crunch and the Great Recession were, for macroeconomics, an intellectual disaster.'' While microeconomics has made great strides in recent years by adapoting science about behavorial economics, macroeconomics is still basing everything on ``rational actor'' models. `` It is a matter of provable fact that our decision-making is not entirely rational. Economic models built on the premise of our rationality will always have a creaky underpinning.'' Macroeconomics also is an insular self-referential field: ``He finds compelling evidence in a survey of American professors of social science, who were asked whether “interdisciplinary” knowledge was better than knowledge “obtained by a single discipline.” Most social scientists sensibly thought that the answer was yes, by overwhelming margins. But 57 percent of economists disagreed or strongly disagreed. Economists literally think they have nothing to learn from anyone else.'' Proposals for fixing this include ``agent based modeling'' which assumes individual behaviors and predicts, among other things, why Brazil nuts move to the top of a mixed-nut package. Also covers how macroeconomics doesn't actually includes allowances for how money works. ``Paul Romer is a highly regarded macroeconomist who recently became chief economist at the World Bank. (It was Romer who is credited with having coined, in 2004, the famous slogan that ``a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.'') Last winter he, too, issued a lacerating critique of his field, titled The Trouble With Macroeconomics. His argument focuses on the question of `identification,' which is shorthand in the field for how economists identify the cause of an event. Identification is a huge deal for economics, because if you can’t tell if x, y or z caused something, you don’t know which of those variables to study or measure or change. The omission of finance and the role of money from economic models is the biggest weakness in the field, Romer believes. It is hard for noneconomists to get our heads around the fact that the dominant macroeconomic models (including the ones used by central banks) made no allowance for how money works — especially not for fluctuations in how much of it is around. Such an oversight seems weird, and entirely counterintuitive. But that’s what happened, and it played a big role in macroeconomists’ ability to, as Romer puts it, "dismiss mere facts."''},

  Title={Should We Trash Cash?},
  journal={The New York Times},
  date={2017-01-10},
  comment={Looks at India's decision to eliminate common cash notes. This was done to undermine the cash economy in a place where the vast majority of people don't pay any income tax. Refers to a book called The Curse of Cash by Kenneth Rogodd which raises one argument for eliminating large denomination bills in the US: There's 4200 dollars in cash circulating for every person in the country, 80\% of that is in 100 bills. Where is all that money? Nobody knows, presumably in some kind of illicit scenario. The author has a different perspective raised at the end of the article though: ``I wonder, though, about the wisdom of the anti-cash crusade. The problem with the argument is that it concedes too much power to the modern triple-headed monster of the economy — the state, the central bank and the banking system. If there is no cash, there is nowhere for the private citizen to hide any assets at all, not just for criminal reasons but simply for financial security. The year 2008 was a reminder of how fragile our banking system is and how all-encompassing financial crisis can be. Merryn Somerset Webb, editor of the financial-advice magazine MoneyWeek, has argued that one of the best things an individual can do, with banks fragile and interest rates low, is buy a good safe and fill it with cash. I have no desire to do that myself, but it is reassuring to know that if I wanted to, I could.  The rich have many ways of hiding assets and making them safe from states and from the taxman. As we’ve recently been reminded, some very rich people don’t pay any income tax at all. Cash is one of the few ways in which ordinary citizens can enjoy a tiny taste of the freedom, privacy and security that the rich take as their due. That, for me, is what’s missing in the critique of cash. If there were to be a big, convincing, systemwide drive to tax the hidden assets of the rich, to drag them inside the same norms that constrain the rest of us, to make it clear that we are all playing by the same rules — well, then maybe we can start to talk about abolishing cash. Until then, we would do well to bear in mind a favorite line of the pro-cash lobby, Dostoyevsky’s observation from a czarist prison: “Money,” he wrote, “is coined liberty.”''},

In return, asset managers collected 162 billion in fees per year for managing 29% of worldwide capital. Estimates from a Sharpe (1992) model imply that their outperformance comes from factor exposures ("smart beta"). If institutions had instead implemented mean-variance portfolios of institutional mutual funds, they would not have earned higher Sharpe ratios. Recent growth of the ETF market implies that asset managers are losing advantages held during our sample period.},

% See NY Times covereage: \url{http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/16/business/economy/nine-new-findings-about-income-inequality-piketty.html} and findings:
% 1 - The bottom half of the country has been shut out from income growth for 40 years.
% 2 - Government spending has helped lift lower incomes, but only a little.
% 3 - Increased health care spending on the elderly consumes most of the gains.
% 4 - The top 1% and the bottom 50% have swapped their relative shares of the national income.
% 5 - Taxes in the United States are much less progressive than they used to be.
% 6 - More women in the work force also helped mitigate rising inequality.
% 7 - But there’s still a spectacular glass ceiling.
% 8 - Since 1999, any upper-middle-class income growth has been after-tax.
% 9 - Taxes and spending helped blunt the effects of inequality and income stagnation.

As a result, they are often seen as arrogant and sometimes are indeed arrogant.'' ``The human species is fantastically complex and often doesn’t know what it is doing.

The Accord effectively tells dirty-energy producers to "use it or lose it." This may be accelerating their extraction and burning of fossil fuels and, thereby, be permanently raising temperatures. 
Our paper uses a simple OLG model to illustrate this long-noted Green Paradox. Its framework treats climate damage as a negative externality imposed by today’s generations on tomorrow’s – an externality that is, in part, irreversible and can tip the climate to permanently higher temperatures. In our model, delaying abatement can lead to larger changes in climate than doing nothing, reducing welfare for all generations. In contrast, immediate policy action can raise welfare for all generations. 
Finally we question the standard use of infinitely-lived, single-agent models, which assume, unrealistically, intergenerational altruism in determining optimal abatement policy. Their prescriptions can differ, potentially dramatically, from those needed to correct the negative climate externality today’s generations are imposing on tomorrow’s.},

On closer inspection, due to mistakes in the colection and calculation of data, it turned out those numbers were wrong, and in fact income increased in rural areas as well. ``Perhaps part of the reason the news media didn’t see the problems in the C.P.S.’s number was that the narrative of a divergence between rural and urban America seemed too irresistible. It confirmed suspicions about a link between people’s economic anxieties in rural America and the rise of Donald J. Trump.

But General Motors will be launching a more affordable, longer-range, and potentially more reliable electric car, called the Chevy Bolt, more or less before Tesla does. This is a mostly a function of GM's size. Perversely, since the federal government limits GM's fleet emmissions, even if GM loses money on electric car sales, just the fact that they are selling them will allow them to sell more of the more profitable SUVs and pickups. In effect, every GM electric car sold is carbon-subsidizing a gas-guzzler. This article also discusses the assembly line quality improvement that Toyota uses where any work on a line can slow the line down if they find something wrong.

 abstract = {How much does the current social security system really redistribute from rich to poor?  We use the PSID to estimate lifetime wage profiles and actual earnings each year for a sample of 1778 individuals, and we use mortality probabilities to calculate expected payroll taxes and social security benefits. For a given set of  facts' about the net flows received by each individual, measured progressivity depends on many assumptions. This paper attempts to capture and to quantify all of the individual characteristics that are relevant to determine the progressivity of a life-cycle program like social security. We proceed in seven steps.  First, we classify individuals by annual income and use Gini coefficients to find that social security is highly progressive.  Second, we reclassify individuals on the basis of lifetime income and find that social security is less progressive.  Third, we remove the cap on measured earnings and find that social security is even less progressive.  Fourth, we switch from actual to potential lifetime earnings (the present value of the wage rate times 4000 hours each year).  This measure captures the value of leisure and home production, so those out of the labor force are less poor, and net payments to them are less progressive.  Fifth, we assign to each married individual half of the couple's income.  The low-wage spouse is then not so poor less progressive.  Sixth, we incorporate mortality probabilities that differ by potential lifetime income.  Since the rich live longer and collect benefits longer, social security is no longer progressive.  Finally, we increase the discount rate from 2% to 4%, which puts relatively more weight on the earlier-but-regressive payroll tax and less weight on the later-but-progressive benefit schedule.  The whole social security system is then regressive.},

  journal={Aeon},
  date={2016-04-07},
  comment = {Outlines the history of the rise of popularity of the word and concept `innovation' and compares that to our cultural neglect of the maintenance of infrastructure. ``In 2012, even the Wall Street Journal got into innovation-bashing act, noting ‘the Term Has Begun to Lose Meaning’. At the time, it counted ‘more than 250 books with “innovation” in the title… published in the last three months’. A professional innovation consultant it interviewed advised his clients to ban the word at their companies. He said it was just a ‘word to hide the lack of substance’.'' ``Evidence has emerged that regions of intense innovation also have systemic problems with inequality. In 2013, protests erupted in San Francisco over the gentrification and social stratification symbolised by Google buses and other private commuter buses. These shuttles brought high-tech employees from hip, pricey urban homes to their lush suburban campuses, without exposing them to the inconvenience of public transportation or to the vast populations of the poor and homeless who also call Silicon Valley their home. The dramatic, unnecessary suffering exposed by such juxtapositions of economic inequality seems to be a feature, not a bug of highly innovative regions.'' ``Third, focusing on infrastructure or on old, existing things rather than novel ones reminds us of the absolute centrality of the work that goes into keeping the entire world going. Despite recurring fantasies about the end of work or the automation of everything, the central fact of our industrial civilisation is labour, and most of this work falls far outside the realm of innovation. Inventors and innovators are a small slice – perhaps somewhere around one per cent – of this workforce. If gadgets are to be profitable, corporations need people to manufacture, sell, and distribute them.'' ``The most unappreciated and undervalued forms of technological labour are also the most ordinary: those who repair and maintain technologies that already exist, that were ‘innovated’ long ago.'' ``Crack cocaine, for example, was a highly innovative product in the 1980s, which involved a great deal of entrepreneurship (called ‘dealing’) and generated lots of revenue. Innovation! Entrepreneurship! Perhaps this point is cynical, but it draws our attention to a perverse reality: contemporary discourse treats innovation as a positive value in itself, when it is not.''},

% ``In her classic 1983 book, More Work for Mother, Ruth Schwartz Cowan examined home technologies – such as washing machines and vacuum cleaners – and how they fit into women’s ceaseless labour of domestic upkeep. One of her more famous findings was that new housekeeping technologies, which promised to save labour, literally created more work for mother as cleanliness standards rose, leaving women perpetually unable to keep up.''

The perception of many on the left is that banks were once well ­regulated and then the oversight stopped. But banking regulation has in fact grown over the past 30 years, with more regulators enforcing more (and more complicated) rules. For many on the right, of course, this is itself the problem: All that government intrusion, they argue, is stifling the financial system. But Richardson and Acharya’s research shows that we’re in a scarier place than either side realizes. By freeing banks’ hands, reducing regulation might incentivize them to engage in more rent-­seeking. But by increasing the complexity of the rules, overregulation can enable rent-­seeking just as easily.'' },

Each essay covers the institutional history of a program, the policy issues surrounding it, its rules and regulations, its history of expenditure and caseloads, and, most importantly, a summary of the research that economists have conducted on the program and the findings from that research. The volume is an update of a popular first volume in 2003 which became a reference Handbook on the shelf of all economists and policy-makers who work on, or who are interested in, transfer programs in the United States. The new volume focuses primarily on the changes in programs which have occurred since 2003 and the results of new research since that date. The volume will be a timely contribution to on-going policy discussions in Washington and elsewhere, bringing the available evidence to bear on the many issues surrounding those programs.},
 comment = {This is the introduction to a book that introduces the economics of different welfare systems. ``While the mix of different programs in the U.S. shown in Table 1 may seem to be a rather crazy - quilt assortment of programs with different structures and recipient groups, rather than following from some single rational desi gn for assistance for the poor of all types, it does reflect what are commonly regarded as voter preferences in the country.  For example, most programs are in - kind in nature, providing subsidies for specific consumption goods like medical care, food consu mption and nutritional assistance, housing, and early childhood education.  When cash is provided, it is generally not provided universally to all low - income families, but only to those with specific characteristics, like workers (the EITC) or the aged and disabled (SSI).   The only quasi - general cash program in the country is the TANF program, but it has shrunk dramatically, providing only a modest level of benefits and only to a restricted set of families, again presumably reflecting disfavor for giving a general cash transfer in return for low income per se.  For example, n o cash program exists for poor , nonelderly and nondisabled childless nonworkers, whether single individuals or married, and only in - kind benefits are provided to other nonworkers.'' ``Five distinct periods are discernible.   The first phase began in the 1960s (although not shown in the figure) and ran through the mid - 1970s.  In this classic period of expansion of the welfare state in the U.S., the AFDC program expanded and grew , the Food Stamp program was exten ded to the nation as a whole, the SSI program was created, and housing aid was expanded.   The second phase ran from the mid - 1970s to the late1980s, when expenditures flattened out, with no growth.   The flattening out was a result of growth in the Food Stamp and housing programs offset by declines in spending on AFDC and SSI.   The third phase, running from the late 1980s to the mid - 1990s, saw another large increase in spending, exceeding that in the early 1970s in some cases.   The growth resulted from major expansions in the EITC and in the SSI and subsidized housing programs.   The fourth phase ran from the mid - 1990s to 2007, with some expansion in overall spending but relatively little on the top 10 programs.  Spending on AFDC declined as it was changed to the TANF program, spending leveled off in the SSI program , housing programs, and the EITC, but a new Child Tax Credi t (CTC) was introduced, pushing up spending.  The Great Recession constitutes the fifth phase, where per capita spending on the 10 largest programs grew by 15 percent from 2007 to 2011, arising from increases in expenditure particularly in the recently - renamed SNAP program, the EITC, and SSI.''},

We offer new evidence about the consequences of gentrification on mobility, building and neighborhood conditions, using longitudinal New York City Medicaid records from January 2009 to December 2015 to track the movement of a cohort of low-income children over seven years, during a period of rapid gentrification in the city.  We leverage building-level data to examine children in market rate housing separately from those in subsidized housing. We find no evidence that gentrification is associated with meaningful changes in mobility rates over the seven-year period.  It is associated with slightly longer distance moves. As for changes in neighborhood conditions, we find that children who start out in a gentrifying area experience larger improvements in some aspects of their residential environment than their counterparts who start out in persistently low-socioeconomic status areas. This effect is driven by families who stay in neighborhoods as they gentrify; we observe few differences in the characteristics of destination neighborhoods among families who move, though we find modest evidence that children moving from gentrifying areas move to lower-quality buildings.},

We test the hypotheses that gentrification directly displaces homeowners by increasing their property taxes, and that property tax limitation protects residents of gentrifying neighborhoods from displacement, by merging the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with a decennial Census-tract-level measure of gentrification and a new data set on state-level property tax policy covering the period 1987 to 2009. We find some evidence that property tax pressure can trigger involuntary moves by homeowners, but no evidence that such displacement is more common in gentrifying neighborhoods than elsewhere, nor that property tax limitation protects long-term homeowners in gentrifying neighborhoods. We do find evidence that gentrification directly displaces renters. },

These genres are determined less by the sound of the music itself than by the people who listen to them.'' ``Vanderbilt makes frequent reference to “Distinction,” Pierre Bourdieu’s pioneering 1979 study of taste as correlated largely with social and educational class, in which the French sociologist asked people of varying educational attainment to say whether scenes like a sunset or “tramps quarreling” would make for a “beautiful, interesting, meaningless or ugly photo.”'' ``He becomes uncharacteristically distraught over the argument — one with which I happen to agree — that a pleasurable cultural experience, even if popular and mass-­produced, shouldn’t be attended by guilt.''

  comment={Thomas Hargrove runs the Murder Accountability Project (MAP) which compiles data on murders in the US and uses basic algorithms to try to detect multiple murders that might have been committed by a single person. Hargrove estimates there might be 2000 serial killers working in the US. There has been a decline in the solving of murder cases --- in 1965 92 percent of of murders were solved, now it's less than 60 percent; about 5000 people are killed each year without getting caught. The Radford Serial Killer Data Base collects reports of about 5000 serial killers around the worl --- most of them are in the US. In prior work Hargrove used statistical analysis in his journalism (inspired by the book called "Precision Journalism" by Philip Meyer) to expose the fact that Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) wasn't actually a real thing, it was in fact people putting their babies in cribs in the wrong way. Hargrove also makes use of a concept called geographic profiling --- most serial killers operate in a specific area that is not too far and not too close to their homes. This is based on work by Kim Rossmo called "Geographic Profiling" which reveals all sorts of statistical likelihoods demonstrated in criminal behavior.},

  journal={The New York Times},
  date={2017-11-12},
  comment={An in-depth look at how cyber tools stolen by The Shadow Brokers from the NSA have been used, and have shaken morale and confidence at the agency. Edward Snowden's release got a lot more media coverage but The Shadow Brokers have released actual code and tools developed by the US and can be used against the US and other targets. Those tools were created at a huge expense to American tax payers and are noe being used by North Korea and Russia against the US and its allies. Millions of people have already been affected, even hospitals have been shut down. More attacks are likely. The US government has to explain to its close allies and business leaders how weapons they developed are being used against them. ``The leaks have renewed a debate over whether the N.S.A. should be permitted to stockpile vulnerabilities it discovers in commercial software to use for spying — rather than immediately alert software makers so the holes can be plugged. The agency claims it has shared with the industry more than 90 percent of flaws it has found, reserving only the most valuable for its own hackers. But if it can’t keep those from leaking, as the last year has demonstrated, the resulting damage to businesses and ordinary computer users around the world can be colossal.''},

% Once again, I suggest that the reason the US government is so paranoid about cyber weapons is because they have developed their own arsenal and know its power. But much like nuclear weapons, most of the actual threat comes from ourselves, not from outside malicious agents.

In particular, it may seem directly opposed to the identity politics that many have now embraced, in order to end those injustices. They are not part of the family of man, they say. They are part of the family of women or African-Americans or gay people, and never mind individualism and case-by-case judgment. But Schor believes that it is precisely this division—the great political quarrel of our time—that Esperanto may be able to heal, by reconnecting us, through a common language, to a shared earth.''},

Discusses how Disney convinced Florida that Epcot would be a utopian city of 20,000 people completely enclosed under a dome with only electric vehicles. Disney was lying about that intent. But since Florida thought it was going to be a city with residents, it granted Disney complete control over all aspects of the development. ``All on the soil where the very first North American utopias, the forgotten Franciscan missions of Spanish Florida, had been destroyed, when the South Carolina colonists burned them at the start of the 18th century, murdering their priests and enslaving their Native American populations. The Disney developers had to clear orange groves left over from those missions'' ``The tunnels represent ground level. Everything else is built on top. Disney World is a giant mound, one of the greatest ever constructed in North America. When you’re walking around in the park, you’re about 15 feet above where construction began.  An importance of these tunnels for Disney was that he could keep the costumed characters invisible, when they weren’t “on.” He didn’t ever want the children to see Pluto, for instance, slouching back from his shift to a break room. So at Disney World, the characters pop up where they’re needed, then disappear.'' `` There is something unnatural or I should say unearthly about Lil’ Dog’s weight, or his density. It was like carrying a meteorite. To carry both girls would have been easier.'' ``We were watching the people. That’s what you do at Disney World, mostly. Above and beyond all else, it’s a place where people look at other people (the lines and the endless walking and the crowded feed stations) to reaffirm the fact that we are there together, that the value of the place is such, it has been worth traveling to from all over the world. I couldn’t tell what we made of one another, in the looking. When Disney World was built, it embodied a shared idea of America as pure capitalist fantasy. It’s no longer communicating that idea; the idea is no longer intelligible. I don’t know what it’s communicating. The old virtues are gone, the new ones unidentifiable.'' ``Unfortunately the pictures were entirely of women’s bottoms.

 abstract = {This paper studies technology adoption in a cluster of soccer-ball producers in Sialkot, Pakistan. We invented a new cutting technology that reduces waste of the primary raw material and gave the technology to a random subset of producers. Despite the arguably unambiguous net benefits of the technology for nearly all firms, after 15 months take-up remained puzzlingly low. We hypothesize that an important reason for the lack of adoption is a misalignment of incentives within firms: the key employees (cutters and printers) are typically paid piece rates, with no incentive to reduce waste, and the new technology slows them down, at least initially. Fearing reductions in their effective wage, employees resist adoption in various ways, including by misinforming owners about the value of the technology. To investigate this hypothesis, we implemented a second experiment among the firms that originally received the technology: we offered one cutter and one printer per firm a lump-sum payment, approximately equal to a monthly wage, conditional on them demonstrating competence in using the technology in the presence of the owner. This incentive payment, small from the point of view of the firm, had a significant positive effect on adoption. We interpret the results as supportive of the hypothesis that misalignment of incentives within firms is an important barrier to technology adoption in our setting.},

% The fucked up thing here is that workers didn't want to adopt a work pattern that was slower because it would affect their ability to earn from their piece work. But then offered a lump-sum payment they were willing to adopt the slower process. In the summary I don't see an analysis about how long the lump-sum payment would outlast their lost earnings from slower work. Effectively you could consider the lump-sum payment a short-term bribe to accept less money long-term.

% In the early part of this book there's an interesting bit about why Nantucket
% became such a whaling hub. Initially they just rowed out from the beach and
% caught whales, but soon there were no more whales and they had to go further
% and further from the island to catch them. Because of their initial effort to
% catch whales, the economy grew around whaling. Even though it seems like it
% must have been an inconvenience to supply the ships from the island instead
% of the mainland, the whaling started there, and so it continued there.
%
% Page 100: The captain is described as not being "fishy" enough (that is
% bullying) to manage the crew in a survival situation. So he
% goes with the democractic choice to sail for South America, rather than his
% instinct to sail for the polynesian islands. This seems to me like just
% chance that his instinct was right. It could easily have been the other way
% around. This section just seems deeply flawed and subscribes to the myth of
% the hard-driving leader.

% second whale (a killer whale) and repairs have to be made.
%
% Page 174-175: The story of the Peggy, where lots were drawn on who was to be

%
% Page 221: the whaling business dies off in Nantucket, quakers losen their
% rules about not showing off wealth, and the town starts to develop
% ostentatious displays of wealth, particularly in their housing. Then a big
% chunk of the town burns down.

% Page 223: The year from the 19th century with the most whales taken was 1837
% with 6767 whales. The year from the 20th century with the most whales taken
% was 1964 with 29,225 whales. (Even though a narrative running through the

% includes this statistic as the justification for romancing
% the 19th century whaling industry - because HE is clearly
% romanced with it. I'm skeptical of his 20th century whales

% “Every time the women appear, Snowman is astonished all over again. They're every known colour from the deepest black to whitest white, they're various heights, but each one of them is admirably proportioned. Each is sound of tooth, smooth of skin. No ripples of fat around their waists, no bulges, no dimpled orange-skin cellulite on their thighs. No body hair, no bushiness. They look like retouched fashion photos, or ads for a high priced workout program.
% "Maybe this is the reason that these women arouse in Snowman not even the faintest stirrings of lust. It was the thumbprints of human imperfection that used to move him, the flaws in the design: the lopsided smile, the wart next to the navel, the mole, the bruise. These were the places he'd single out, putting his mouth on them. Was it consolation he'd had in mind, kissing the wound to make it better? There was always an element of melancholy involved in sex. After his indiscriminate adolescence he'd preferred sad women, delicate and breakable, women who'd been messed up and who needed him. He'd liked to comfort them, stroke them gently at first, reassure them. Make them happier, if only for a moment. Himself too, of course; that was the payoff. A grateful woman would go the extra mile. 
% "But these new women are neither lopsided nor sad: they're placid, like animated statues. They leave him chilled.” Page 100
% “What is toast?” says Snowman to himself, once they’ve run off. Toast is when you take a piece of bread – What is bread? Bread is when you take some flour – What is flour?
% We’ll skip that part, it’s too complicated. Bread is something you can eat, made from a ground-up plant and shaped like a stone. You cook it . . . Please, why do you cook it?
% Why don’t you just eat the plant? Never mind that part – Pay attention. You cook it, and then you cut it into slices, and you put a slice into a toaster, which is a metal box that heats up with electricity – What is electricity? Don’t worry about that. While the slice is in the toaster, you get out the butter – butter is a yellow grease, made from the mammary glands of – skip the butter. So, the toaster turns the slice of bread black on both sides with smoke coming out, and then this “toaster” shoots the slice up into the air, and it falls onto the floor . . .
% Forget it,” says Snowman. “Let’s try again.” Toast was a pointless invention from the Dark Ages. Toast was an implement of torture that caused all those subjected to it to regurgitate in verbal form the sins and crimes of their past lives. Toast was a ritual item devoured by fetishists in the belief that it would enhance their kinetic and sexual powers.
% Toast cannot be explained by any rational means.

% The part where the zone is described as a "roadside picnic" of aliens is pretty good. Near that section (the same character dialog) are some interesting thoughts about the rationality of man - as in what the hell do we even think it is? And some neat points about how the smartest among us are panicked because they realize how little they know.
% That same section has some thoughts about the military-industrial complex.
% The Tarkovsky film was from a screenplay by the same authors, but is best understood as a complete reboot. While this is more or less schlocky 1970s sci-fi, the film is a reboot that throws out the schlock and instead focusses on heavily-lifted concepts of human meaning.
% The funny thing is that while the book is really from the perspective of some 1960s-70s "everyman" and the movie is from the perspective of high-minded art and philosophy, I would think a real-life stalker going into the zone would be neither of those things, but have elements of both.
% Oddly, the book is set in Canada.
% There's some interesting hints about the economics of the city that grows up around the Zone. Reminds me of the city that is built around the crashed ship in Robotech.

% It's impossible to read this book after having read Lost Girls without reading a whole second story between the lines about maturing sexually. It has some interesting narrative bits, where the narrator addresses the reader directly, and sometimes the narrator influences the plot (for example, waking up the kid's mother). For me it is also hard to read this book without hearing the broadway musical in the lines.

% He begins the book with Santayana's quote about those who do not
% remember the past being condemned to relive it. As if understanding
% the rise of the Nazi's will help us prevent it in the future.
% I believe that's up for debate, but it clearly doesn't really apply to
% Trump. There are SO many differences between Trump and Hitler. Shirer
% makes a strong argument that the rise of the Nazis simply couldn't
% have happened without the specific man Hitler. It's an astonishing
% thing to think about, but Hitler brought a specific insane evil genius
% to the Nazis that would have left them basically powerless without
% him. Unlike Trump who is just an evil idiot and it can be easily
% imagined how 100 other monsters could have easily been in his place
% instead of him. Hitler had a whole army already by the time he got any
% real power, and using that army for violence to show strength was one
% of his key tactics. It's hard to imagine anything like that with
% Trump. The only thing that is similar is the use of lower-middle
% working class anger to stir up political support.
% In reality, those who remember the past are condemned to be shocked
% by the ability of fresh new horrors to arise from almost anywhere.
% A person who studies history with the idea that there are patterns
% that could repeat is doomed to never understand the real risks of bad
% things happening.
% Hitler _believed_ in the power of a single man to shape history - he
% also believed that a dictator was a _real_ option for running a
% country. I think neo-Nazis don't actually have ANY sense that a
% dictator is a good option - their motivation is to engage in racism
% without feelings of guilt, and in no small part, want to piss off
% mainstream thinking.
% The idea that a single person has such influence feels very outdated
% now. Today, the _systems_ are more powerful than any individual - and
% not fully understood by any individual, as Adam Curtis points out. It's
% a RADICALLY different time than the rise of the Nazis. The SYSTEMS run
% things, Trump could be swapped out with a hundred other horrible
% people. And Trump is far from all powerful - his entire time in power
% has been battling the system that crushes him - but that's not to say
% that his opponents have any more control over the system than he does.
% Page 8: how Hitler almost had the last name of Schicklgruber. Both
% Shirer and Hitler himself point out that he probably would not have
% achieved much if he hadn't had the name Hitler instead. The power of a
% name cost millions of people their lives.
% Page 19: Hitler's attempt at art, includes ads for Teddy's
% Perspiration powder and Santa Claus selling candles.
% Page 21: Hitler's dedication to the power of violence to show
% strength.
% Page 25: Hitler's realization of the power of oratory.
% Page 43-44: Hitler designs the Nazi flag. Interesting stuff here:
% he's a failed artist, but there's no question that a _design_ piece
% the Nazi flag is among the most effective things ever made. The
% description of ancient swastikas here, and the somewhat mysterious
% adoption of it by Hitler makes one think that this symbol that's been
% with us for all of humanity might have contained some trans-temporal
% sense of what it would become? Maybe it always HAS been the Nazi
% symbol, has ALWAYS been evil, so evil that the ancients had a sense of its
% importance long before the Nazis were invented? Considered in light of
% the more crazy mathematical solutions to theoretical physics, it
% starts to seem like an interesting idea... Though obviously not
% ACTUALLY science or history.
% Also the flag said "Germany Awake!" on it - raising interesting
% questions about the idea of being "woke".
% Page 56: The constitution of the Weimar Republic was modern,
% well-balanced, and had strong representation. See also critiques in
% footnote on this page.
% Page 61: In 1923 it took 4 billion marks to buy a dollar.
% In the 1920s the government let the value of the mark tumble, as a way
% to free themselves from debt, and escape reparations.
% Page 96: Late 19th Century Germany had the most comprehensive social
% security network maybe in the world. It profoundly influenced the
% working class by making them value security, and seeing the state as
% benefactor and protector. Hitler took advantage of this. (In footnote.)
% Page 100, footnote: Nietzsche said in Thus Spoke Zarathustra "Thou
% goest to women? Do not forget they whip!" Bertrand Russell said of this
% "Nine women out of ten would have got that whip away from him, and he
% knew it, so he kept away from women."
% Page 144: Deutsche Bank on the list of banks that financed Hitler.
% Page 195: The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was
% their failure to unite against it. 
% Page 185: "Fourteen years of sharing political power in the Republic,
% of making all the compromises necessary to maintain coalition
% governments, had sapped the strength and the zeal of the Social
% Democrats until their party had become little more than an opportunist
% pressure organization, determined to bargain for concessions for the
% trade unions on which their strength largely rested"
% Page 212: Hitler wins a staggering (if questionably honest) election

% Page 223: The purge of the S.A. resembles the settling of all debts

% Page 227: German officers fell back on their honor codes, often
% citing "honor" as the reason for supporting the Nazi state. And thus by
% honoring their oath, they dishonored themselves as human beings.
% Page 232: Before the war, Nazi Germany was open to visitors, and the
% tourist industry thrived. 
% Page 240: The Nazis persecuted the Christians too, since Christianity
% was considered incompatible with Nazism. The Nazi Church required the
% removal of crosses from churches and that they be replaced with a copy
% of Mein Kampf on the altar, and a sword. And of course a swastika.
% Page 244: the story of the terrible Nazi art show, and the popular

% Page 248: "No one who had not lived for years in a totalitarian
% land can possible conceive how difficult it is to escape the dread

% Page 259: Prussia during the 18th and 19th centuries spent 5/7 of the

% Page 260: The Nazi government would create alternate currency to pay
% industrialists, like the Mefo bill.
% Page 266 and 267: How Volkswagon got its start (but not successfully)

% Page 271: The Nazis would arbitrarily arrest people and put them in
% concentration camps and call it "protective custody"
% Page 273: People paid to spy on the general population of Germans for
% the Nazis were young intellectuals recruited from universities. So there
% was a bizarre atmosphere of pedantry and an interest in things like the

% Page 327: Hitler intends to build the greatest skyscrapers the world
% has seen.
% Page 338: Any time an opponent concedes something to the Nazis, they
% raise the stakes and demand more.
% Page 424-427: The results of Munich: Here, again, you can see how
% it was mostly just Hitler's "luck" that allowed him to succeed so
% spectacularly. Chamberlain was committed to appeasement for fear of
% another major war. Hitler was committed to war, fully intending to
% invade Czechoslovakia. Later analysis shows that Chamberlain was
% completely wrong to appease Hitler - the combined forces of Europe
% would have easily defeated him at the time (if the plot to overthrow
% him by the German generals had been executed and failed). And Hitler
% was wrong to think he even COULD have attacked Czechoslovakia - which
% had near-impregnable mountain defenses built against German attacks.
% Appeasement SAVED Hitler from his own intentions which would have
% defeated him, and gave him a chance he didn't know he needed to build up
% further strength. Nobody knew that at the time - it is just the random
% twists and turns of history that repeatedly let Hitler succeed.
%
% Page 966: Hitler and the Nazis started mass execution of the jews early

@article{lethem2016curtis,
  Author={Lethem, Jonathan},

  Title={It All Connects},
  journal={The New York Times},
  date={2016-11-27},
  comment={A profile of Adam Curtis, the British documentary maker who tackles politics and culture. ``The films take familiar subjects — the Cold War, the growth of public relations or financial or military-industrial bureaucracies, the premises of the ecology or anti-psychiatry movements, the enmeshment of Western democracies in quasi-colonial military adventures in the Middle East — and render them strange. Stories that might seem like “social studies” fodder become, in Curtis’s hands, compulsive, like a giddy horror film you can’t quit watching.'' He is a master of finding obscure archival footage from the BBC archive and compiling it into a narrative explaining 20th Century history in a completely new way. His most famous films include: ``If Americans like Morris and myself have tended to learn of Curtis’s work beginning with “The Power of Nightmares,” his British viewers usually started earlier, with his landmark treatises on the biases of technological utopian social thinking (“Pandora’s Box,” 1992); on propaganda, historical amnesia, brainwashing and nostalgia (“The Living Dead,” 1995); on the growth of popular psychiatry and public relations, and the merging of the cult of personal fulfillment with consumerist imperatives (“The Century of the Self,” 2002). “The Century of the Self,” in particular, is seen by many in Britain as Curtis’s signature accomplishment. These early works construct a kind of “bible” of Curtis’s thinking, upon which his later arguments build.'' },

}
% Other interesting quotes from this article:
``“This is the whole thing about ‘good and evil’ — it’s a naïve view of the world. The problem is bigger, it’s a system.” Curtis and I briefly discussed a word coined by the critic Timothy Morton to describe a problem so vast in space and time that you are unable to apprehend it: a “hyperobject.” Global warming is a classic example of a hyperobject: it’s everywhere and nowhere, too encompassing to think about. Global markets, too. But naming a hyperobject alone is of limited use; human cognition knows all too well how to file such imminent imponderables away, on a “to-do” list that’s never consulted again.''
% ``“One week I was sent up to Edinburgh to film a singing dog,” he said. “His owner said that when he played the bagpipes, the dog would sing Scottish songs. We set the camera up. The owner dressed up in a kilt and started to play the bagpipes. The dog refused to sing. It just sat there looking at me just saying nothing. It just sat there, with a really smug look on its face. This went on for about two hours.” Curtis phoned his producer. “She said: ‘Darling, that is wonderful. Don’t you see that the dog refusing to sing for a man dressed up in a kilt is actually very funny? Go back and keep filming. Film the dog doing nothing. But film the man as well.’ ” “So I did. We ran a long close-up shot of the dog’s face with the sound of out-of-tune bagpipes. It was quite avant-garde, but the audience loved it, especially when you cut it against the face of the man puffing at the bagpipes who genuinely believed that the dog was about to sing. “That time with a dog taught me the fundamental basics of journalism. That what really happens is the key thing; you mustn’t try and force the reality in front of you into a predictable story. What you should do is notice what is happening in front of your eyes, and what instinctively your reaction is.''
% ``Curtis prefers Balzac, the novelist of intricate social tapestries, to the modernist tradition of interiority defined by Woolf and Proust. But the novelist he claims as inspiration is Dos Passos, whose “U.S.A.” trilogy he read when he was a boy, and whose centrifugal blend of pastiche and documentation may be the key to Curtis’s style. At the other end, Curtis’s artistic nemesis is Andy Warhol. “I’ve got this idea. I call it the I.A.R., the Inappropriate Aesthetic Response. I date it back to Warhol. It’s this idea you can take horrific images like the electric chair and aestheticize them. The beheading videos, the orange jumpsuits against the desert background; ISIS uses that knowingly. I have a ruthless theory, that the radical-art movement, which grew out of the failure of revolutionary politics, becomes the outriders for the property developers. You need the aesthetic of decline in order to make those buildings desirable.” “HyperNormalisation” is a summation of one of Curtis’s major themes: that liberalism — since the collapse of certainty about how its values would transform politics, finance and journalism — has in fact become genuinely conservative. In a world of unpredictability, it has retreated from genuine frontiers, instead opting for holding actions that can make it feel stable and safe.''
% ``Curtis’s critiques of the internet sometimes echo those of skeptics like Jaron Lanier, who sees it as a dead end for art, and Evgeny Morozov, who questions its ability to effect social change. “The internet was invented by engineers,” Curtis tells me. “When engineers build a bridge, they don’t want it to develop, they want it to stay stable. And the same is true of the fundamental engineering system of the internet. It’s based on feedback. And feedback is about stability. So, what happened with Occupy, and with Tahrir Square, is that it was a great system to get everyone together into a group, but then it had absolutely no content. It’s a really terrible mistake they made — they mistook an engineering system for a revolutionary set of ideas.”''
% ``Elsewhere, Curtis sounds like a science-fiction writer — one from the 1950s, when S.F. writers began accurately satirizing the world we find ourselves in today. “The utopia they hold out is a world where machines make everything for you and you have endless leisure time, you become creative and everyone’s happy. And the only thing is, actually, everyone’s incredibly unhappy because they haven’t got anything to do. What we call our jobs today are actually fake jobs. We sit in our offices in front of our screens in order to get the money to go out and buy stuff. Our job is really to go shopping. And the rest of the time, we sit in our offices doing complicated managerial things, and when we’re not, we’re actually watching the internet. The internet is there to keep you happy during your fake job.” Curtis’s antic side, however, can’t turn away from the bloody wreckage. “I see people in shops now, going through Instagram, and then looking at things like ‘Is this right?’ It’s almost like they’re reading the Bible. It’s absolutely fascinating. Instagram is the aestheticization of everything. What began with Modernism, which is to actually worry about how things are done rather than about what they’re saying, has now ended with Instagram. I love it.''
% ``“What will happen to the internet in the future?” He’s riffing again. “Will it become a bit like a John Carpenter movie? You go there, amidst the ruins, and it’s weird, and you can be nasty — just have fun and be bad, like a child. From about ’96 to about 2005 people built these lovely websites, they put up masses and masses of fantastic information. They’ve left them sitting there, but it’s like a city that everyone’s gone from. And what’s come in instead is a weird world where you don’t know what’s real — just people shouting at each other. It’s good fun, but it’s not real.”''
% ``Curtis seems to cherish his place in America as a voice seeping from under the floorboards. In a way, the ruined apocalyptic John Carpenter city appears to be where he wants to live.''
% ``Speaking of “The Power of Nightmares,” he told me, “A lot of people said, ‘Oh, the television networks in America would never show it.’ What I’d noticed is that the moment I put it out, it went up on the internet. I understood at that point that it would have more political power and be seen by many more people if I let it be a thing that people want to find illegally.” (Virtually all of Curtis’s films are available to the intrepid Googler for free viewing, but if I told you where to find them, they might vanish.)''
% On seeing HyperNormalisation: poses the idea that the world has become so complicated that nobody can control it anymore. Instead people in power simply try to prevent disasters from occuring - mostly through "perception management". Reality doesn't matter, only people's perception of it, which is maleable.
% There is an amazing sequence of disaster movies featuring actors with wide-eyed stares at some horror of destruction (usually a collapsing building) set to Dream Baby Dream by Suicide - all movies leading up to 2001. 
% Also poses the idea that liberals rerteated from reality to cyberspace (which is now mostly online videos) --- because it was too complicated to understand, and the protests of the iraq war suggested that they couldn't change reality.
% This article is about the BlackRock data center in Washington state, Aladdin,  that Adam Curtis talks about in HyperNormalisation: \url{http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21591164-getting-15-trillion-assets-single-risk-management-system-huge-achievement}
% On seeing Pandora's box: In a number of these documentaries there's points where the people in power are embarrassed that their ideas didn't work, and so their next step is not to admit failure, but to try something new without admitting they were wrong.
% This makes me think that a major tool for change is to recognize that you have to give the politicians a chance to get out of what they have done without having to admit they were wrong. Perhaps the right KIND of protest or riot - or asking for the right thing, might give a politician the opportunity to get out and save face: "not because I was wrong, but because we need peace in the streets, I am changing course"
% Adam Curtis might be one of the few (or only) people dealing with the systems of power by trying to think about them systematically. Or at least he's one of the only one's doing it in a way that's comprehensible to normal people.
% Think of his construction, "they believed that...". He uses it all the time. It's a whole WAY of thinking about power - that the people in power don't KNOW anything, they just BELIEVE something, and try to apply what they believe. More often than not, they are wrong.
% See notes following kudler2017urbanpolitics
% The movie Cube (1997) features a giant machine which appears to have no purpose but to torture people. It is revealed during the movie that it is a huge public works project - a bridge to nowhere - that was begun, then continually funded and built because nobody really knew what it was or what it was for. After being completed people are put into it simply because it exists and therefore should be used. The monologue where this is explained bears uncanny resemblences to Adam Curtis' current thinking about world power systems.

  comment = {The classic tome in which Mumford looks deeply at the long history of cities and tries to tease out the specifics aspects that let them thrive or caused them to fail. Mumford has a deep appreciation of social justice (and a lot of criticism of ``modern'' (that is, 1960s) life is slipped in) but he also comes from a school (garden cities) that believed there was a perfect size and organization of cities that could be achieved. Those things are what he looks for. So, Rome is examined in light of its eventual failure. Eventually in Rome 1/3 of the days of the year are holidays. (Many of those holidays are circuses, with elephants and tigers and whatnot. Mumford postulates that the remnant of those carried down as a subculture for thousands of years to the circus we have today.) For Mumford, Rome's vices cause it to miss the perfect city size/relationship, and it grows huge solely on econimic power, causing it to fail.},

% Mumford's idea of how the dark ages ended: people were scattered widely around the countryside in Europe. The Vikings got organized in warfare, and started attacking along the coast, and deep into the countryside. People in started building walls around the towns (again - this technique had been lost since Roman times.) The walls created safe spaces for merchants, markets and capitalism to thrive, cities grew, and trade and science reestablished themselves.

% Quotes:
% ``democracies are often too stingy in spending money for public purposes, for its citizens feel the money is theirs. Monarchies and tyrannies can be generous, because they dip their hands freely into other people's pockets.''
% ``What goes so lavishly into space rockets of our time went, with perhaps little more visible reward, into equally monumental architecture almost equally empty of human benefit. In both cases, paranoid power learned to 'rationalize' the expression of its irrationality by its homage to art or science.''
%``From the standpoint of both politics and urbanism, Rome remains a significant lesson of what to avoid: its history presents a series of classic danger signals to warn one when life is moving in the wrong direction. Wherever crowds gather in suffocating numbers, wherever rents rise steeply and housing conditions deteriorate, wherever a one-sided exploitation of distant territories removes the pressure to achieve balance and harmony nearer at hand, there the precedents of Roman building almost automatically revive, as they have come back today: the arena, the tall tenement, the mass contests and exhibitions, the football matches, the international beauty contests, the strip-tease made ubiquitous by advertisement, the constant titillation of the senses by sex, liquor, and violence – all in true Roman style. These are symptoms of the end: magnifications of demoralized power, minifications of life. When these signs multiply, Necropolis is near, though not a stone has yet crumbled. For the barbarian has already captured the city from within. Come hangman! Come vulture!'' Page 242
% ``Instead of evading the ugly realities of his time, the Christian embraced them. by doing willingly what pagans sedulously avoided, he both neutralized and in some measure overcame the forces that threatened him. He visited the sick; he comforted the widow and the orphan; he redeemed the ignominies of starvation, sickness, and squalor by making them am occasion for fellowship and love. Instead of clinging for security and comfort to the presense of large crowds, he accepted their dispersal and looked for solace in a more intimate union when only two or three were gathered together in the name of Christ: indeed, the holiest withdrew altogether, seeking solitude and silence.'' page 244
% ``Cities are like trees; once established, they must be destroyed to the roots before they cease to live: otherwise, even when the main stem is cut down, shoots will form about the base as happened in Jerusalem even after its complete destruction in A.D. 70. What Lavedan calls the ``law of the persistence of the place'' might even be widened into the ``persistence of the individual urban archetype.'' page 245
% ``In the past half century architecture has turned from enclosure to exposure: a virtual replacement of the wall by the window. Even in the dwelling house, as Henry James was quick to note on his visit to the United States in 1905, all sense of intimacy and privacy was being forfeited by throwing one room into another, to create a kind of exposed public space for every moment and for every function. This movement has perhaps now reached the natural terminus of every such arbitrary interpretation of human needs. In opening our buildings to the untempered glare of daylight and the outdoors, we have forgotten, at our peril and to our loss, the coordinate need for contrast, for quiet, for darkness, for privacy, for an inner retreat.'' page 269
% Medieval guild halls: ``But those that have been preserved often vie in their magnificence with the town hall or cathedral. W. J. Ashley notes that the cost of these buildings was ``one of the circumstances which led to the restriction of the membership to more wealthy members of the community. Not the first or the last time in which the pomp of a great architectural shell has destroyed the creature who burdened himself with its creation....'' Page 271
% ``But in the university, the pursuit of knowledge was elevated into an enduring structure, which did not depend for its continuance upon any single group of priests, scholars, or texts. The system of knowledge was more important than the thing known.'' Page 276
% ``Those who refer to the winding streets of such a town as mere tracings of the cowpath do not realize that the cow's habit of following contours usually produces a more economical and sensible layout on hilly sites than any inflexible system of straight streets.'' Page 301. So - grids are great in 2-dimensional space, but cowpaths work better if the site has 3 dimensions.
% ``Even town-planning theorists have made such errors, largely because of their failure to grasp the difference, familiar to students of biology, between homologous and analogous forms. A similar form does not necessarily have a similar significance in a different culture; again similar functions may produce quite different forms.'' Page 301
% ``Not without statesmanlike cunning, the Pope insisted on making the Franciscan order an instrument of Papal power, and he ensured its subordination, indeed its inner subversion, by encouraging a heavy investment in appropriate conventual buildings, in the very birthplace of the new order; for there is no quicker way of killing an idea than to `materialize' it too soon.'' Page 319 
% ``The canals, now some 177 in all, serve as the boundaries of these neighborhoods, as well as connecting links: they are both waterbelts and arterial highways, functioning like the greenbelts and through motor ways of a well-designed modern town, though not so reckless of urban space as American highways or the neighborhood greenbelts of English New Towns frequently are. \ldots By making the most of their opportunities, in other words, the Venetians, no doubt inadvertently, invented a new type of city, based on the differentiation and zoning of urban functions, separated by traffic ways and open spaces. This was zoning on the grandest scale, practiced in a rational manner, which recognized the integrity of neighborhoods and which minimized the wasteful `journey to work.' Page 323
% ``The urban community was kept in some degree of balance because its ruling group at least paid the price for their system, as totalitarian states do today, by trading security for freedom: thus they provided over many centuries for steady industrial employment, social services of many sorts, and dazzling public festivals. So, typically, it was not the workers, but rival members of the ruling class that usually threatened treason or revolt.'' Page 324 So - by taking care of the working classes, they didn't have to worry about revolt from below, but from a coup of their colleagues who couldn't do whatever they pleased with the working classes.
% On the changeover to guns as the primary weapons of war: ``The need for more costly sinews of war put the cities into the hands of usurious oligarchies that financed the ruler's mischievous politics, lived sumptuously on the profits and the loot, and sought to entrench their positions by backing the ensuing despotism.'' [there's a little more on this page - 361]
% It's kind of amazing how anyone living through that process probably didn't even realize it was happening. Long-term trends like that seem to need hundreds of years of hindsight.
% Mumford references ``Sombart'' (presumably in the bibliography): ``Soldiers, as Sombart has pointed out, are pure consumers, even as in action they are negative producers.'' - To keep a standing army is to simply buy tons of stuff without them ever actually producing anything. Page 362.  
% ``The change from a goods economy to a money economy greatly widened the resources of the state. \ldots To increase the boundaries of the state was to increase the taxable population: to increase the population of the capital city was to increase the rent of land. \ldots Capitalism in turn became militaristic: it relied on the arms of the state when it could no longer bargain to advantage without them: the foundations of colonial exploitation and imperialism.'' page 363-364
% ``The long approach and vista into seemingly unbounded space---those typical marks of the baroque plan---were first discovered by the painter.'' And from here he goes on to fashion, and then to history. From war to fashion in two pages! page 365
% ``The gain in the power of systematic thought and in the accurate prediction of physical events was to justify itself in the nineteenth century in a series of mighty advances in technics. But in society the habit of thinking in terms of abstractions worked out disastrously. The new order established in the physical sciences was far too limited to describe or interpret social facts, and until the nineteenth century even the legitimate development of statistical analysis played little part in sociological thought. Real men and women, real corporations and cities, were treated in law and government as if they were imaginary bodies; whilst artful pragmatic fictions, like Divine Right, Absolute Rule, the State, Sovereignty, were treated as if they were realities. \ldots With the quest for financial and political power, the notion of limits disappeared---limits on numbers, limits on wealth, limits on population growth, limits on urban expansion: on the contrary, quantitative expansion became predominant. The merchant cannot be too rich; the state cannot possess too much territory; the city cannot become too big. Success in life was identified with expansion. This superstition retains its hold in the notion of an indefinitely expanding economy.'' Page 366
% ```The world,' as Stow remarked when the fashion was taking hold in London, `runs on wheels.''' Page 368
% ``In walking the eye courts variety, but above this gait, movement demands repetition of the units that are to be seen: it is only so that the individual part, as it flashes by, can be recovered and pieced together. What would be monotony for a fixed position or even in procession, becomes a necessary counterpoise to the pave of fast-moving horses.'' Page 368
% ``On irregular streets, poorly paved, with plenty of loose cobblestones and places of concealment, the spontaneous formations of untrained people have an advantage over a drilled soldierly: soldiers cannot fire around corners, nor can they protect themselves from bricks heaved from chimney tops immediately overhead: they need space to maneuver in. \ldots To rule merely by coercion, without affectionate consent, one must have the appropriate urban background.'' Page 369-370 [Does this suggest that in addition to the right to bear arms, we should compel the government to provide us with irregular and hard to understand street systems? it would, after all, help the resistance fight the battle to keep the government honest!]
% During what Mumford calls the Baroque period, there was a split in use types: homes were split from workplaces. Producing, selling, and consuming were separated into three different institutions, and three different sets of buildings, three distinct parts of the city. The housewife loses touch with affairs of the outside world, and works instead only on domesticity or sex. Increased domesticity also weakened public interest of middle-class citizens. Page 383
% ``To make up for the lack of effective domestic work, a new type of housework was invented that took up the slack and enriched the ritual of conspicuous consumption. I mean the care of furniture. \ldots Display outstripped use; and the care of furniture commanded time that once went to weaving tapestries, the embroidery of garments, the mailing of useful household preserves, perfumes and simples. These new burdens were inflicted upon housewives and domestics at the very moment that the form of the house itself changes, multiplying the number of private chambers...'' Page 383
% ``Up to the seventeenth century, at least in the North, building and heating had hardly advanced far enough to permit the arrangement of a series of private rooms in a dwelling. But now a separation of functions too place within the house as well as within the city as a whole. Space became specialized, room by room.'' Page 384
% In context of Da Vinci and the Italian ``bulldozing'' habit of mind: ``The wholesale remove of the buildings embodying these forms of life [human households, shops, churches, neighborhoods] would wipe out the co-operations and fidelities of a lifetime, often many lifetimes. The in making a `clean job' the planner would have to destroy precious social organ that could not be replaced as easily as streets can be paved and houses build did not seem important to the early military engineer and more than it seems to his twentieth-century successors, in charge of `slum clearance projects' or highway designs.'' Page 387
% ``Living space, in the baroque plan, was treated as a leftover, after the avenue itself determined the shape of the houseplot and the depth of block. With this neglect of urban functions other than traffic went an overvaluation on the geometric figure: a square\ldots a nine-sided figure with radio-centric streets,\ldots a partial star \ldots The abstract figure delimits the social contents, instead of being derived from them and in some degree conforming to them. The institutions of the city no longer generate the plan: the function of the plan is rather to bring conformity to the prince's will in institutions.''
% ``If one compares the handsome geometry of a baroque plan with the kind of patient, piecemeal replacement and modification suggested in Rowland Nicholas' plans for the rebuilding of Manchester, one discover the specious advantages of this administrative superficiality.'' Page 402. Might be worth looking up those Manchester plans.
% ``Once wheeled traffic is treated as the chief concern of planning, there will never be enough space to keep it from becoming congested, or a high enough residential density to provide taxes sufficient to cover its exorbitant demands.'' Page 405
% ``What steamship companies discovered in the nineteenth century in their exploitation of steerage passengers, the ground landlords discovered long before: maximum profits came, not from providing first class accommodations for those who could well afford them at a handsome fee, but from crowded slum accommodations, for those whose pennies were scarcer than the rich man's pounds.'' Page 417. This is a pretty amazing statement, it suggests that in capitalism, you will never get as rich offering _options_ to people who can afford them, as you can selling _necessities_ to people who can't afford them.
% ``If a layout of a town has no relation to human needs and activities other than business, the pattern of the city may be simplified: the ideal layout for the business man is that which can be most swiftly reduced to standard monetary units for purchase and sale. The fundamental unit is no longer the neighborhood or precinct, but the individual building low, whose value can be gauged in terms of front feet: this favors an oblong with a narrow frontage and great depth, which provides a minimum amount of light and air to buildings, particularly to dwellings, that conform to it.'' Page 421-422
% ``With this blank formal layout, no thought was given to either the direction of the prevailing winds, the circumscription of industrial districts, the salubrity of the underlying soil, or any of the other vital factors that determine the proper utilization of an urban site. As for orientation of buildings for maximum exposure to winter sunlight, that ancient necessity, know to both the Greeks and the Chinese, was completely overlooked, until the principle was belatedly re-established by a series of independent investigators, notably by the French planner, Augustin Rey, early in the twentieth century. And one further lack must be noted: the absence of any functional differentiation between the residential, the industrial, the commercial, and the civic quarters---though if their requirements were respected each would demand blocks of different lengths and depths, with appropriate streets and avenues, to accord with their different loads of traffic, and their functionally different building layouts.'' Page 423-424
% Mumford references Arturo Soria y Mata's Linear city. He was a Spanish planner who had an early notion of transit oriented development. ``The gridiron plan reached its ideal culmination in Se\~{n}or Soria y Mata's proposal for the Linear City. Himself a transportation engineer, he boldly proposed to make the new city a function of a spinal rapid-transit system, projecting a continuous urban belt parallel to the transportation lines, to connect the old historic centers. Motorized movement was all-controlling.'' Page 425
% ``In estimating the need for new subways in New York, for example, almost half a century ago, the engineer of the Public Service Commission furnished the classic statement of these aims: ``All lines must necessarily be laid to the objective point---Manhattan. Every transit line that brings people to Manhattan adds to its real estate value. The value of property on Manhattan Island on account of its geographic and commercial location must increase just so long as population in the surrounding territory increases.'' The object of a good transit system might be the more even distribution of industrial and commercial opportunities, of good housing facilities, and even of land values, so that the whole process might have some other aim than enriching the holders of land in Manhattan at the expense of the rest of the metropolitan community, seems not to have occurred to this na\"{i}ve agent.'' page 425
% ``Hence the peculiar function of the over-developed street in the commercial plan: it was forced to take the place of the back garden and the protected square of the medieval town, or of the open place and park of the baroque order. Thus this paved desert, adapted primarily to wheeled traffic, became also park promenade, and playground: a grim park, a dusty promenade, a dangerous playground.'' Page 427
% ``Rapid public transportation, instead of reducing the time required for reaching the place of work, continued to increase the distance and cost with no gain in time whatsoever. What holds true for the horizontal extension of the commercial city in the nineteenth century and later, holds true equally for its vertical expansion by means of the elevator.'' Page 430. So you can think of your commute as something that is 3-dimensional if you include the ride up the elevator.
% ``To understand the source of this congestion, apart from the desire for wringing profits out of the necessities of the poor, unable like their economic superiors to bargain and withhold acceptance, one must realize that by the seventeenth century destitution had been accepted as the normal lot in life for a considerable part of the population. Without the spur of poverty and famine, they could not be expected to work for starvation wages. Misery at the bottom was the foundation for the luxury at the top.'' Page 432
% ``Part of the economic use of the capital city, was to discredit local goods, which varied in pattern, in color, in stuff, in texture, in decoration, in accordance with local traditions, and give circulation to those in use at the capital.'' Page 437
% ``In our time the ultimate fate of the commercial city is to become a backdrop for advertising: a fate well symbolized by the recent transformations of New York's two railroad stations from great public monuments to exhibition halls for a commercialism whose tawdriness by contrast gives almost a regal dignity to the financiers who originally conceived these stations with some sense of public obligation.'' Page 445
% ``Up to the nineteenth century, there had been a rough balance of activities within the city. Though work and trade were always important, religion and art and play claimed their full share of the townsman's energies. But the tendency to concentrate on economic activities, and to regard as waste the time or effort spent on other functions, at least outside the home, had been growing steadily since the sixteenth century.'' Page 446
% ```Without design' was a laudatory term in the Victorian period. As in the decadent period of Greece, Chance had been elevated into a deity that was supposedly in control not only of human destiny, but of all natural processes as well.'' Page 452. He goes on to tie this idea to Darwin.
% ``To bring back fresh air, pure water, green open space, and sunlight to the city became the first object of sound planning: the need was so pressing that despite his passion for urban beauty, Camillo Sitte insisted upon the \emph{hygenic} function of the urban part, as a \emph{sanitary green}, to use his own expression: the `lungs' of the city, whose function became newly appreciated through their absence.'' Page 475
% Webb - 19th century - municipal socialization ``In smaller centers, private companies might be left with the privilege of maintaining one or more of these services, until some notorious outbreak of disease dictated public control; but in the bigger cities socialization was the price of safety; and so, despite the theoretic claims of the laissez faire, the nineteenth century became, as Beatrice and Sidney Webb correctly point out, the century of municipal socialism. Each individual improvement within the building demanded its collectively owned and operated utility: watermains, water reservoirs, and aqueducts, pumping stations: sewage mains, sewage reduction plants, sewage farms.'' Page 476
% Grave errors of railroads repeated by cars - ``At the very moment the elevated railroad for public transportation was being eliminated as a grave nuisance, these forgetful engineers re-installed the same kind of obsolete structure for the convenience of the motor car.'' Page 479 (mid)
% modern buildings are above ground versions of underground technology - ``The next step in the city's development, already taken in many American cities, is to extend the principle of the underground city even to the design of buildings that are visibly above ground, and so defeat art at every point. With air conditioning and all-day fluorescent lighting, the internal spaces in the new American skyscraper are little different from what they would be a hundred feet below the surface. No extravagance in mechanical equipment is too great to produce this uniform internal environment: though the technical ingenuity spent on fabricating sealed-in buildings cannot create the equivalent of an organic background for human functions and activities.'' Page 480 - bottom
% suburban freedom -  ``The great residual freedom of the suburbanite is that of locomotion. For esthetic and intellectual stimulus, the suburb remains dependent upon the big city: the theater, the opera, the orchestra, the art gallery, the university, the museum are no longer a part of the daily environment. The problem of re-establishing connections, on a regional rather than a metropolitan basis, is one of the main problems of city planning in our time.'' 493 (bottom) - 494 (top)
% Is the above still true? Should we be trying to figure out how to reconnect the suburbs? Or just give up? Or figure out a non-locomotion way to bring the suburbs better connection-like things?
% The fastest way to move 100k is on foot - ``What an effective network requires is the largest number of alternative modes of transportation, at varying speeds and volumes, for different functions and purposes. The fastest way to move a hundred thousand people within a limited urban area, say a half mile radius, is on foot: the slowest way of moving them would be to put them all into motor cars.'' Page 507 (bottom)
%  ``The organizers of the ancient city had something to learn from the new rulers of our society. The former massed their subjects within a walled enclosure, under surveillance of armed guardians within a smaller citadel, the better to keep them under control. That method is now obsolete. With the present means of long-distance mass communication, sprawling isolation has proved an even more effective method of keeping a population under control. With direct contact and face-to-face association inhibited as far as possible, all knowledge and direction can be monopolized by central agents and conveyed through guarded channels, too costly to be utilized by small groups or private individuals. To exercise free speech in such a scattered, dissociated community one must `buy time' on the air or `buy space' in the newspaper. Each member of Suburbia becomes imprisoned by by the very separation that he has prized: he is fed through a  narrow opening: a telephone line, a radio band, a television circuit. This is not, it goes without saying, the result of a conscious conspiracy by a cunning minority: it is an organic by-product of an economy that sacrifices human development to mechanical processing.'' Page 513 top
% Does the above change in light of the internet? Or did we miss an opportunity, when the internet was going to be a two-way thing, the early days when every single person would have their own web page?
% Howard's term `Garden Cities' isn't really unfortunate, since it is more descriptive of suburbs which are far less dense than Howard was calling for. His plans were distinctly urban, calling for density similar to NYC in 1811. In converse, Letchworth and Welwyn are true Howard garden cities, and should not be mistaken for mere suburbs. - 519 (top)
% ``So far, then, Howard's proposals have failed to halt or even retard the automatic processes that are at work in our civilization. The underlying reason for this failure is that Western civilization is still carried along by the inertia of three centuries of expansion: land expansion, industry expansion, and population expansion; and these movements have taken place at a rate that would have made public organization and containment difficult, eve if the need for a more stable life-economy had been recognized.'' Page 524 - % But Howard's plan was for only 30k people at a time, how could it even have addressed the scale of what cities have become?
% Ethereal powers city walls - ``Both the citadel and the wall had long been obsolescent in the great capitals; but at the very moment they disappeared, a network of organizational controls centering in the dominating capital city, ramifying by instant communication everywhere, came into existence and performed the same functions more effectively. Just to the extent that new powers were shadowy, impossible to pin down or come to grips with, etherialized, they were all the more effective. One might breach a city wall or kill a king: but how could one assault an international cartel?'' page 531 (bottom)
% 19th century is a history of illness says Lavedan - page 532
% concentrate organs of administration - ``Once the means of instantaneous communication were available, there was a fresh incentive to concentrate the organs of administration \ldots all these devices aided the rise of a vast commercial bureaucracy, capable of selling in ever-remoter territories by establishing the fashionable patterns of the metropolis as identical with civilization itself, or with anything that could remotely be called `real life.' '' page 534
% ``The concentration of the rich is a typical metropolitan phenomenon. The princely ritual of conspicuous expenditure, no longer confined to the royal court, gives rise to the special luxury industries of the metropolis: dress, food, adornment, cosmetics. Because of the universal nature of the metropolitan standards, the exotic fashions of the rich are presently copied and reproduced on a mass scale for the benefit of the entire populace: that indeed is a necessary pillar of an expanding economy.''page 538
% ``In short the monopoly power and knowledge that was first established in the citadel has come back, in a highly magnified form, in the final stage of metropolitan culture. In the end every aspect of life must be brought under control: controlled weather, controlled movement, controlled association, controlled production, controlled prices, controlled fantasy, controlled ideas. But th only purpose of control, apart from the profit, power, and prestige of the controllers, is to accelerate the process of mechanical control itself. The priests of this regime are easy to identify: the whole system, in its final stages, rests on the proliferation of secret, and thus controllable, knowledge; and the very division of labor that makes specialized scientific research possible also restricts the number of people capable of putting the fragments together. But where are the new gods? The nuclear reactor is the seat of their power: radio transmission and rocket flight their angelic means of communication and transportation: but beyond these minor agents of divinity the control room itself, with its Cybernetic Deity, giving His lightning-like decisions and His infallible answers: omniscience and omnipotence, triumphantly mated by science. Faces with this electronic monopoly of man's highest power, the human can come back only at the most primitive level. Sigmund Freud detected the beginnings of creative art in the infant's pride over his bowel movements. We can now detect its ultimate manifestation in paintings and sculpture whose contents betray a similar pride and a similar degree of autonomy---and a similar product.'' page 542
% ``For unfortunately, once an economy is geared towards expansion, the means rapidly turn into an end, and "the going becomes the goal." Even more unfortunately, the industries that are favored by expansion must, to maintain their output, be devoted to goods that are readily consumable, either by their nature, or because they are so shoddily fabricated that the must soon be replaced. By fashion and built-in obsolescence the economies of machine production, instead of producing leisure and durable wealth, are duly cancelled out by mandatory consumption on an ever larger scale.'' - page 545
% ``By the same token, the city itself becomes consumable, indeed expendable: the container must change as rapidly as its contents. This latter imperative undermines a main function of the city as an agent of human continuity. The living memory of the city, which once bound together generations and centuries, disappears: its inhabitants live in a self-annihilating moment-to-moment continuum. The poorest Stone Age savage never lived in such a destitute and demoralized community.'' - page 545 (top)
% ``That life is an occasion for living, and not a pretext for supply items to newspapers, interviews on television, or a spectacle for crowds of otherwise vacant bystanders---these notions do not occur to the metropolitan mind. For them the show is the reality, and "the show must go on!" The metropolitan world, then, is a world where flesh and blood are less real than paper and ink and celluloid. It is a world where the great masses of people, unable to achieve a more full-bodied and satisfying means of living, take life vicariously, as readers, spectators, listeners, passive observers. Living thus, year in and year out, at second hand, remote from the nature that is outside them, and no less remove from the nature within, it is no wonder that they turn more and more of the functions of life, even thought itself, to the machines that their inventors have created. In this disordered environment only machines retain some of the attributes of life, while human beings are progressively reduced to a bundle of reflexes, without self-starting impulses or autonomous goals: 'behaviorist man.''' - page 547 (bottom)
% ``Strangely the greatest justification for metropolitan congestion has passed almost unnoticed. Through the operation of these forced the big city, in the nineteenth century, served by way of size and variety of its population to foster functions that had never been sustained on anything like the same scale before: corporate associations and societies of like-minded persons, pursuing special interests that covered every aspect of human life. Up to this time, the church, the university, the school, the guild, had been the main foci of associated activities, apart from the city itself. But from the Renascence onwards, these new associations began to flourish and took a thousand different forms: scientific societies, museums, social clubs, insurance associations, political parties, economic groups, historic societies, fellowships of all kinds.'' - page 551 (now, with internet, what?)
% [The Spruce Goose might have been an evolutionary dead end, but it was evolution nonetheless]
% ``In its own right, the historic city retains, by reason of its amplitude and its long past, a larger a more various collection of cultural specimens than can be found elsewhere. Every variety of human function, ever experiment in human association, ever technological process, every mode of architecture and planning, can be found somewhere within its crowded area.'' Also a paragraph here about how cities pull in culture from wide distances around them and sort them.'' - page 562 (middle)
% ``Though the great city is the best organ of memory man has yet created, it is also---until it becomes too cluttered and disorganized---the best agent for discrimination and comparative evaluation, not merely because it spreads out so many goods for choosing, but because it likewise creates minds of large range, capable of cooing with them.'' - Page 562 (bottom)
% ``In the Museum of Mural in the Palais de Chaillot, a large number of admirable replicas of these paintings have been brought together. In a single afternoon one may see more paintings than one could take in comfortably in a fortnight of travelling. ... With color slides now available, the process could be carried even further: any small-town library or museum might borrow, and show in a projection room an even larger collection of murals.'' - Page 564 (top)
% Nice description of the electric power grid --- a centralized power station, no matter how big, would only be able to reach so far. But our power system is made up of many small stations, each generating power in its own way, and serving its local area, but connected to the larger grid so other areas can pull in power from elsewhere on the network if needed. Then he compares that to the English library system. -  page 565 (middle)
% ``Through its concentration of physical and cultural power, the city heightened the tempo of human intercourse and translate its products into forms that could be stored and reproduced. Through its monuments, written recored, and order habits of associate, the city enlarged the scope of all human activities, extending them backwards and forwards in time. By means of its storage facilities (buildings, vaults, archives, monuments, tablets, books), the city became capable of transmitting a complex cultures from generation to generation, for it marshalled together not only the physical means but the human agents needed to pass on and enlarge the heritage. That remains the greatest of the city's gifts. As compared with the complex human order of the city, our present ingenious electronic mechanisms for storing and transmitting information are crude and limited.'' -  page 569
% ``Without the superposition of many different human activities, many levels of experience, within a limited urban area, where they are constantly on tap, too large a portion of life would be restricted to record-keeping. The wider the area of communication and the greater the number of participants, the more need there is for providing numerous accessible permanent centers for face-to-face intercourse and frequent meeting at every human level.'' - page 569 (bottom)

Steel and glass had a hypnotic effect upon the `progressive' nineteenth century minds, and still have on their successors. This ideal form derived from the hothouse.'' and ```All under one roof' may prove just a mock-up for the terminal form of the anti-city: `all in one underground shelter.'

% ``Stuyvesant Town, was built by a private insurance company with generous aid by the State: but its residential density of 393 per acre remains that of a slum. Despite its inner open spaced, this housing would require eighty additional acres to provide the part and playground space now regarded as desirable, nineteen more than the entire project without the buildings.'' - Plate 46
% Mumford argues for garden cities because he still believes in the factory/worker relationship. He doesn't anticipate the power of urban _mixing_.
% ``Witness the combination of shops, business and professional offices and municipal buildings show here, with an open plaza admirably designed---I speak as an eye witness--- for staging public ceremonies. No isolated shopping centers can compare in either convenience, efficiency, or human interest with the complex activities of a genuine civic center. The planning of cities cannot be confined to `housing, work, recreation, and circulation,' the standard planner's definition: the whole city must rather be conceived mainly as a theater for active citizenship, for education, and for a vivid and autonomous personal life.'' - Plate 61 (bottom)
% Mumford puts forward a Chinese painting of the Festival of Spring as the ideal model of a city. - Plate 64

% ``Indeed, even the theories used daily to guide scientific research are now considered to be incomplete, or at least less formally logical than classical views assumed them to be. Science-in-practice is often driven by hunches and vague impressions.'' 
% ``The incompleteness of everyday theories should not surprise most scientists. We frequently discover that a theory that seems crystal clear and complete in our head suddenly develops gaping holes and inconsistencies when we try to set it down on paper.'' 
% ``Laypeople rarely have to offer full explanations for most of the phenomena that they think they understand. Unlike many teachers, writers, and other professional “explainers,” laypeople rarely have cause to doubt their naïve intuitions. They believe that they can explain the world they live in fairly well.'' 
% ``A second feature leading to the IOED may be a confusion of higher with lower levels of analysis. Most complex artificial and natural systems are hierarchical in terms of explanations of their natures. In explaining a car one might describe the function of a unit, such as the brakes, in general terms, and then turn to describing the functions of subcomponents, such as pistons and brake pads, which in turn can be broken down even further. The iterative nature of explanations of this sort may lead to an illusion of understanding when a person gains insight into a high level function and, with that rush of insight, falsely assumes an understanding of further levels down in the hierarchy of causal mechanisms. This effect can easily happen for many natural and artificial systems with complex causal structures, especially those that have “stable subassemblies.” The concept of stable subassemblies was developed by Simon (1996) as a way of describing units in the hierarchical structure of complex systems that are sufficiently internally stable that they can be conceived of as an operational unit.'' 
% ``It may be that phenomena that are easy to visualize, and especially those that are easy to mentally animate, trigger an especially strong illusion of understanding and these may be more common in the domain of causal explanations.'' 
% ``In short, if people have a drive for coherence and sense coherence when it emerges in a set of beliefs, they may confuse that sense of coherence with a more detailed understanding. Indeed, this may be a more accurate way of characterizing the levels-of-understanding confusion.'' 
% ``Since it is impossible in most cases to fully grasp the causal chains that are responsible for, and exhaustively explain, the world around us, we have to learn to use much sparser representations of causal relations that are good enough to give us the necessary insights: insights that go beyond associative similarity but which at the same time are not overwhelming in terms of cognitive load. It may therefore be quite adaptive to have the illusion that we know more than we do so that we settle for what is enough. The illusion might be an essential governor on our drive to search for explanatory underpinnings; it terminates potentially inexhaustible searches for ever-deeper understanding by satiating the drive for more knowledge once some skeletal level of causal comprehension is reached.''

% ``The unalterable fact of their tribal life was that women had no rights at all and could choose nothing. A girl was usually given away as soon as she was born. She was the absolute property of her kin until marriage, whereupon she became the equally helpless possession of her husband. The idea of a marriage based on romantic love was as culturally absurd to the Iora as it was to most Europeans. The purpose of betrothal was not, however, to amalgamate property, as in European custom, but to strengthen existing kinship bonds by means of reciprocal favors, It did not change a woman's status much. Both before and after, she was merely a root-grubbing, shell-gathering chattel, whose social assets were wiry arms, prehensile toes, and a vagina.''
% ``As a mark of hospitality, wives were lent to visitors whom the Iora tribesmen wanted to honor. Warriors, before setting out on a revenge raid against some other aboriginal group, would swap their women as an expression of brotherhood. If a tribal group was about to be attacked and knew where its enemies were, it would sometimes send out a party of women in their direction; the attackers would then show that they were open to a peaceful solution by copulating with them. But if the women came back untouched, it was a signal that there was no choice by battle. A night's exchange of wives usually capped a truce between tribes. On these occasions most kinship laws except the most sacred incest taboos were suspended. Finally, at the great ceremonies or corroborrees, which involved hours of chant and ecstatic dancing and were meant to reinforce the tribe's identity by merging all individual egos into one communal mass, orgiastic sex played a part. However, since these affairs were rarely seen, sketchily described and never understood by the early colonists, it is impossible to say how large or how strictly prescribed a part it was. If a woman showed the least reluctance to be used for any of these purposes, if she seemed lazy or gave her lord and master any other cause for dissatisfaction, she would be furiously beaten or even speared.'' - Page 16
% - So much for the argument that women's equality could be rooted in some kind of primativist framing. The BDSM community plays their little games of fantasy lifestyles that resemble this - but who would want to actually live in this world, if given the option?
% ``We are tied to the Georgian past through artifacts that we would still like to use, given the chance. The town houses, squares, villas, gardens, paintings, silver and side tables seem to represent an "essence" of the eighteenth century, transcending "mere" politics. Since they present an uncommonly coherent image of elegance, common sense and clarity, we are apt to suppose that English society did too. Btu argument from design to society, like the syllogism that ascends from the particular to the general, usually goes awry.'' - Page 19
% ``The Georgian London a modern visitor imagines was not their city. There were two such Londons, their separation symbolized by the cleavage that took place as the rich moved their residences westward from Covent Garden between 1700 and 1750, as the speculators ran up their noble squares and crescents---an absolute gulf between the new West End and the old, rotting East End of the city.'' - Page 10
% ``London was judged the greatest city in the world, but also the worst smelling. Sewers still ran into open drains; the largest of these, until it was finally covered in 1765, was the Fleet Ditch. Armies of rats rose from the tenement cellars to go foraging in daylight.'' - Page 20
% ``To speak of an eighteenth-century "working class" as though it were a homogeneous entity, united by class-consciousness and solidarity, is both anachronistic and abstract. It is a projection of the twentieth century onto the eighteenth. Loyalties ran between workers in the same trade, but rarely between workers as such.'' - Page 20-21

% ``In practice, high-security prisons are still human zoos. But the liberal view is that a jail is a sad but necessary expedient, harsh but susceptible of reform, which, if decently run, can keep a criminal out of social circulation without making him or her much worse. No such opinions were held two hundred years ago. Then it was clear that prisons, before they are institutions, are \emph{concentrations of criminals}: Their institutional definition began with the fact of criminality, not the hope of reform, and their essential nature was to degrade all their occupants by the relentless moral pressure of the group. The prison pickled the felon in evil, hardened him, perfused him with the hard salt of sin. Hence the loathing in which English jails were held by those who would never see the inside of one. They were the republics of a sublimated criminal class; they belonged to the antipodes of crime, not to the bright world of authority, which they represented only in a nominal way.'' - Page 39

% ``For the official English morality of the early nineteenth century was far more absolutist than ours. Today's orthodoxy is to look for the environmental excuse and seek the roots of crime in nurture, not nature---that is, outside the criminal's power of choice. One hundred and fifty years ago it was assumed that men and women \emph{chose} a life of crime.'' - Page 167
% ``Such ideas, however, were in themselves a harshly coercive part of the social environment and may have caused many people to give up the struggle---to let go, to be what society said they would become, and accept the only milieu that would not rebuke them: crime.'' - Page 167
% ``Many observers realized that crime does not appear in a social vacuum. From 1800 onward, a large literature---at first Evangelical in tone and rising at last to the power of Dickens's encyclopedic vision of the city as ultimate social and moral compressor---sought to describe the causes of crime: poverty, lack of work, dislocation, vile housing, addiction, the death of hope.'' - Page 167
% ``The difference between the ``criminal classes'' of London and the \emph{classes dangereuses} of Paris was that the English were not as dangerous; events like the Gordon Riots in London were the exception, not the rule.

Getting across it, therefore, became an obsessive focus of convict ingenuity. They walked, crept, ran, waded and even hopped. One prisoner, a former actor named William Hunt, "who in his younger days had belonged to a company of strolling mountebanks," disguised himself as an enormous "boomer" or male kangaroo. He nearly got across to Forestier's Peninsula before two picket-guards, thinking he really was a kangaroo, spotted him and gave choice , levelling their muskets.

``Gold disturbed the order of Anglo-Australian society - from pastoral "aristocrat" down to convict-with shudders of democracy. Gold wealth was not "democratic," but it did expand the existing oligarchy. It would diversify both Australian markets and Australian production and help create Australian bourgeoisie. The clay-stained digger, a butcher in his former life, who still carried the grease-stink of tallow in his hair and argot of the diggings on his tongue, would soon have his Axminster-carpeted drawing room in Toorak. The cash his gold set in circulation would construct suburbia. His spending habits would raise more merchants to comfort. Fortunes were made by diggers-and extracted from them. Gold did respect class. It slightly favored the low: A horny-handed navvy miner or seaman with muscles hardened by years of manual work could sing a shaft twenty feet to the blue auriferous strata of Bendingo in the time that it took a refined "new chum" his hands pulpy and blistered, to scratch away three feet of earth.'' ``"We be the aristocracy now," miners were heard to say as they rollicked in the Melbourne grog-shops, "and the aristocracy now be we.''

  comment={An in-depth look at the effects of the GULAG on the prisoners in it.},
}
% See photo: ``By changing nature, man changes himself'' of a woman with a jackhammer working on the White Sea Canal 
% This book is 600 pages of listings of the minutia of daily life of the GULAG prisoners. Written in the modern academic style it is edited for content not at all, and not written in a way that tells any kind of story.
% It does HINT at what could be an amazing book: documenting the effort at total top-down control of an economy, making heavy use of this mechanism of the GULAG. How at the top they continually kept trying to tweak the GULAG to work better, and instead managed to make it worse at the bottom, with the expected declining output overall.
% ``Another form of torture specific to the islands, mentioned in both archives and memoirs, was to be sent ``to the mosquitoes.'' Kinger, a White Army officer who later made one of the few successful escapes from Solovetsky, wrote that he once saw this torture inflicted on a prisoner who complained because a parcel sent to him from home had been requisitioned. Angry prison guards responded by removing all his clothes, including his underwear, and tying him to a post in the forest, which was, in the northern summer, swarming with mosquitoes. ``Within half an hour, his whole unlucky body was covered with swelling bites,'' wrote Klinger. Eventually, the man fainted from the pain and loss of blood.'' - Page 24
% ``Mussolini once said of Lenin that he ``is an artist who has worked in men as others have worked in marble or metal.'' This description may be better applied to Stalin, who literally enjoyed the sight of large numbers of human bodies, marching or dancing in perfect synchronization. He was captivated by ballet, by orchestrated exhibitions of gymnastics, and by parades featuring giant pyramids built out of anonymous, contorted human figures. Like Hitler, Stalin was also obsessed with cinema, particularly Hollywood musicals, with their enormous casts of coordinated singers and dancers. He might have derived a different but related form of pleasure from the vast teams of prisoners who dug canals and build railway lines at his bidding.'' - Page 53
% Chapter 4, on the White Sea Canal, is pretty good. But the White Sea Canal, dug by hand with primitive tools at great cost in both money and human life was again replaced by the railroad, just like the Erie Canal and other US canals. Canals were a technological fad of the 19th into 20th centuries. People with more foresight may have seen their inevitable demise.
% On pages 213-215 there is a lovely description of how the awful black bread became sacred, and the rituals that arose around it. There's a nice description of how if you are starving you need to eat your food slowly, but all at once in about half an hour. It isn't good to stretch it out over the course of the day. 
% Since crossing the tundra or the taiga means days of traveling with little or no food, some prisoners would plan their escape with a extra person, preferably a fat person, who they would call ``the meat'' or ``the walking supply.'' The meat of course would be killed and eaten when food supplies ran low. - Page 398
% Description of, and doubts about the book The Long Walk - it may just be a retelling of Rudyard Kipling's short story The Man Who Was. (Which makes sense in the context of other parts of this chapter which talks about how people who could tell a really good story could use that as a way to get extra food and supplies from other prisoners. Story telling was an extremely valued commodity. Maybe The Long Walk is a prison-story-told version of The Man Who Was?) Page 399
% The story of how Beria almost immediately after the death of Stalin started the first wave of amnesty for prisoners. Perhaps because nobody knew better than he how abusive and uneconmical the prison system was. Page 480

  Category={Criticality, Transportation, Economics, flooding, mississippi, engineering, new orleans, nola}
}
% The men in power made moves to dynamite the levees even though the preponderance of scientific evidence suggested the levees would be fine due to other levees failing further up the river.
% The book suggests they did this to protect their investments in NOLA (most of the men involved were bankers.)
% The idea was that even if the levees held, people were panicking and leaving the city, and thus impacting their investments.
% I think it's equally likely that these men of power felt like they COULD take action, and so they did. And they knew other people EXPECTED them to take action, and so they did.
% It makes me wonder about willful people: are they likely to push through bad ideas, to take action where NOT taking action is the right move, just because they CAN take action? Should these people really be our leaders?
% One theme that recurs throughout this book is that _labor_ was understood at the time as a critical resource to industry. In the early part of the century, while labor was recognized as being _people_, it was ALSO talked about at a higher level as just a cold resource, in a way that would never be tolerated today. (Even if the old way is actually more accurate.)
% Labor, like soylent green, is people. Then, the needs for labor outweighed the fact that labor is people. This was well understood in the south. Without slavery, how do you keep labor in the remote parts of the country where it was needed for planting?
% The easiest way was to treat people well. But as soon as the flood arrived, there was nothing left to treat them well with. And so they FORCED the labor to stay. By not evacuating them. By holding them in camps.
% Labor was treated as people only as long as it benefited capitalism. As soon as treating them as people wasn't feasible, the necessary resource was retained in alternative ways.
