Experiment style:

@article{zimmer2020sewers,
  Author={Zimmer, Carl},
  url={https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/science/coronavirus-sewage-monitoring-lockdown.html},
  Title={Is It Safe to Come Out of Lockdown? Check the Sewer},
  journal={The New York Times},
  date={2020-05-05},
  comment={The technology to take samples from sewage and predict the amount of virus in the population is developing, soon the point where it may be possible to predict an outbreak in a specific neighborhood before anyone tests positive. This technology obviously extends beyond just covid.},

@article{green2020sidewalkshed,
  Author={Green, Peneloppe},
  url={https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/style/scaffolding-new-york-city.html},
  Title={Our Lives, Under Construction},
  journal={The New York Times},
  date={2020-01-02},
  comment={300 miles of sidewalk sheds in NYC. Most are up for about a year, but some have been up for 11 years.},

@article{appelbaum2020historicpreservation,
  Author={Appelbaum, Binyamin },
  url={https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/opinion/historic-preservation-solar-panels.html},
  Title={When Historic Preservation Hurts Cities},
  journal={The New York Times},
  date={2020-01-26},
  comment={Argues that Historic preservation, in practice, is not about preserving history. It is about preserving the lifestyle of an affluent urban elite." Argues that while preservation of historically significant buildings is important, individual houses are not historically significant. Quotes Rem Koolhaus arguing that EVERYTHING should be preserved, if we're going to preserve at all. And therefore Koolhaus is in favor of strips of preservation through a city.},

@article{pietrzak2020affordability,
  Author={Pietrzak, Adrian},
  url={https://cbcny.org/research/rent-and-ride},
  Title={Rent and Ride Affordability is About Both},
  journal={Citizens Budget Commission (CBC)},
  date={2020-01-13},
  comment={When both transportation costs and housing costs are considered together as a portion of income, NYC is only an averagely expensive city among 20 peer cities. Even though housing costs are high, transportation costs are very low. When these things are considered together, Houston ends up being about as expensive as NYC, and it's residents earn less so they pay a greater share of their income to live there.},

% Though this doesn't account for the fact that you get a bigger space and own your own car in Houston, assuming you wanted those things.

##### Other things to do:
* [ ] Finish break out by sections and experiments to see how github pages renders bib style
* [ ] Write up a disclaimer in README about how this is fairly raw first impressions, not researched or intended for publication
* [ ] Update README for bibliography.git (if this all works) to say it is no longer being used and is just for archival purposes
