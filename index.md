# Bibligraphy
This is a bibliography of everything I've ever read that has any kind of resonance with me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Topics:
### [Urbanism](Urbanism.md)
### [Housing](Housing.md) 
### [ULURP](ULURP.md) 
### [Zoning](Zoning.md) 
### [Transportation](Transportation.md) 
### [Sport](Sport.md) 
### [Health](Health.md) 
### Music 
### The Art 
### Criticality 
### Politics (And Public Policy)
### Humanity 
### Science 
### Economics 
### Other Stuff 
### Novels 
### Long Entries 


## Key to entries
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@article{uniqueidentifier,  
  Author={Last, First and Last, First},  
  url={http://www.example.com},  
  Title={Title pasted from Article},  
  journal={Publication name},  
  date={2020-07-dd},  
  comment={This is a description of the article, and sometimes some thoughts and or comments that I might also have about the article.},  
  category={From the topics list above, plus whatever other categories I made up that I feel like the article belongs to. Comma separated, lowercase.}  
}  
% Further comments start with % because that's how latex does it. (Though I think bibtex doesn't actually require a % for a comment between entries.)
 


## Why this formatting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because it lets me pull the entries as bibtex. Long-term viability, etc.

###### Other things to do:
* [ ] Finish break out by sections and experiments to see how github pages renders bib style
* [ ] Write up a disclaimer in README about how this is fairly raw first impressions, not researched or intended for publication
* [ ] Update README for bibliography.git (if this all works) to say it is no longer being used and is just for archival purposes
