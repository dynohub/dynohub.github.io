% While I love the simplicity of this approach, it's easy to imagine that in a

% neighborhoods for development and gentrification.  
% On the other hand, sometimes a simple big move like this, even with some  
% negative consequences, can be empowering for people - think of the  
% application of rent stabilization in NYC. Since eliminating single-family  
% zoning EVERYWHERE is something that is much more easily grasped than careful  
% tinkering with the code in certain places, it lends itself to democratic

  comment={There's a bill in legislation in California that would allow eight-story buildings near major transit stops, even if that violates local zoning laws, or local residents object. It's an effort to create more dense compact cities. ``Transportation accounts for one-third of the nation’s carbon-dioxide emissions and recently surpassed power plants as its largest contributor to global warming. Even as stricter federal standards push cars to become more fuel efficient, the gains have been steadily offset as Americans drive more.'' Includes links to studies (plural) showing that people in compact cities have a smaller carbon footprint than those living in spawl or suburban areas. ``This is partly because they often live in apartments that require less energy to heat and cool than large single-family homes, but also because they commute shorter distances and are more likely to walk or take public transit.'' But land use and zoning varies in every locality, so it can be very difficult to implement large-scale change. Even though land use impacts everything. And overriding local opinion can contribute to housing cost issues and eliminating local voices.},

In Boston, however, housing prices are high EVERYWHERE, suggesting that housing is just more expensive for everyone, and Boston could build neighborhoods of any kind to address the problem, while Atlanta desperately needs more ``city'' oriented neighborhoods.},

  comment={An update on the Bushwick rezoning. Makes the point that nobody knows if it is better to upzone, downzone, or have a hydbrid. And maybe it doesn't even matter, maybe zoning doesn't have the power to control displacement and gentrification. ``As City Limits reported on Tuesday, the relationship between rezonings and displacement is poorly understood. Contextual zonings may preserve neighborhood form, but they don’t necessarily stop displacement; some say they worsen it by limiting the citywide allowing housing supply, creating more competition for existing units. But upzonings also bears risks: Encouraging investment in the neighborhood could drive up prices in housing units nearby. And one study showed that after “hybrid” rezonings—a combination of a contextual rezoning on side streets and an upzoning on commercial corridors—rents also skyrocketed, and demographic change was even starker. In other words, when it comes to using zoning to curb displacement, it seems you’re damned if you boost density, damned if you reduce density, and damned if you do nothing at all—and, perhaps, damned if you even try to talk about it.''},

abstract = { Problem, research strategy, and findings: Income segregation has risen in each of the last four decades in U.S. metropolitan areas, which can have lifelong impacts on the health, economic productivity, and behaviors of residents. Although it is widely assumed that local land use regulations—such as minimum lot sizes and growth controls—exclude low-income households from wealthier neighborhoods, the empirical research is surprisingly limited. We examine the relationship between land use regulation and segregation by income using new measures for the 95 biggest cities in the United States. We find that density restrictions are associated with the segregation of the wealthy and middle income, but not the poor. We also find that more local pressure to regulate land use is linked to higher rates of income segregation, but that more state control is connected to lower-income segregation.Takeaway for practice: Density restrictions do drive urban income segregation of the rich, not the poor, but should be addressed because rich enclaves create significant metropolitan problems. Planners at the local level need assistance from regional and state efforts to ameliorate income segregation. Inclusionary housing requirements have a greater potential to reduce income segregation than bringing higher-income households into lower-income parts of the city. Finally, comprehensive and consistent data on the impacts of local land use regulations should be collected to inform future research and planning practice. },  
comment = {Covered by Richard Florida in this article: \url{http://www.citylab.com/housing/2016/01/how-zoning-restrictions-make-segregation-worse/422352/}. Florida sums up: ``the authors find that the main effect of density restrictions is to enable the wealthy to wall themselves off from other groups.'' ``Density restrictions in the city not only lead to higher housing prices (think San Francisco), but to greater economic segregation across a metro as a whole.'' ``segregation varies by both the nature and extent of government involvement, as well as the type of land use restriction. Notably, the authors discover that segregation is not associated with a broad measure of land use restriction overall, but is instead the result of more specific types of regulation and restrictiveness.'' ``Places that require multiple levels of approval to get housing built are more segregated, largely because such regulations hinder new housing development.'' ``Segregation is lower in cities and metros where state governments are more involved in land use regulation, residential development, and growth management.'' ``the authors point out that “efforts to force wealthier parts of [the] city to build housing for low-income households, or inclusionary housing, are more effective at reducing segregation than bringing higher-income households into lower-income parts of the city.”''},

% So while over 40 percent of the City’s land lots were rezoned during the Bloomberg administration, only 28 percent of the City’s residential units have been rezoned. (See Figure 2). This is because a significant numbers of the rezoned land lots were in lower - density neighborhoods and therefore account for a disproportionately low share of the City’s residential units.

Includes brief but good description of 421a. ``Given the wide range of market rents in New York City neighborhoods, this means additional zoning density will be extremely valuable to developers in some areas, but may have little or no value in others.'' ``Large sections of New York City do not have sufficient market strength for high-density mixed-income development to be viable without other forms of subsidy, even if already eligible for the generous 421-a property tax exemption.'' ``In much of the city, upzonings may make sense for long-term planning purposes and to accommodate larger subsidized buildings, but they do not appear to hold much potential for cross-subsidizing affordable units because even fully market-rate buildings are not currently being built in these areas.'' ``One lesson our analysis highlights is that requiring a unit to be affordable at any level far below market has a much larger effect on a project’s financial return than the exact level of affordability it must provide.''},

They had originally gone to the Bloomberg administration asking them to rezone this area from M1-1 to an MX like all the other MXs. But DCP said they were too busy to look at it because it was in the waning days of the administration. Gib said that actually turned out to be a blessing because they now think a regular MX rezoning would have just resulted in residential development. Their new proposal is for MX with required manufacturing on the first two floors, and 3 residential above. Gib also pointed out that CB8 went to DCP \emph{requesting} this MX rezoning as a way to promote economic development in the area.},
